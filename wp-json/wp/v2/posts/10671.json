Gone are the days when only a minor section of people used to opt for an MBA degree. That too just for the sake of getting a degree. Nowadays, students opt for this course because it is highly lucrative. Over the past few decades, the demand for an MBA degree has increased manifold, especially among working professionals. With the introduction of open and distance learning mode more and more students are taking advantage of it to study further. This helps them to explore more career options while also utilising their spare time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:4px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Distance Education Valid in India?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On September 2, 2022, the UGC released a notification saying that Open and Distance Learning Courses are now at par with regular courses. The main objective of this move was to promote distance education and increase the literacy rate in the country.&nbsp; As per the notice:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/sbqUNCmg2x6Gwt9CBP0Q23HTUDY4OE0JUUtE8HBcdBzfcoABFvbXszpG5Ui1_g7ipk-1fwKFdSyuUOL_kKr8AYL_OO4hQThHwybmGgNlg1CjQ5ck_-a8kywJZWjzJx9_ehPKxBhMTxJel7-s7a13Wl1gzTLztERDv0C7YR0QgqcsfLKsggQ13MmBlpQ9Lg\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another regulation that you should look out for is the one released by UGC-DEB. According to the guidelines, no university is allowed to deliver technical courses such as BE and B.Tech in distance mode. Therefore, opting for courses like MBA, MCA and other humanities courses is more beneficial.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are considering choosing a course in ODL mode, first, do consider the accreditations of the universities. Second, compare what the university is deliversing and what India\u2019s official statutory bodies have given permission to. Also, understand the gap between the two.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:4px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Distance MBA vs Regular MBA<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to surveys, <strong>in the academic year 2019-20, 51.8% students took at least one distance course<\/strong>.

However, there are many universities, such as Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies, that offer placement opportunities to the students enrolled in their distance MBA courses. NMIMS also extends access to Career Development Services and free Alumni Portal. This helps students to network with prominent recruiters, alumni of the university and industry experts. Therefore, it will not be wrong to say that distance MBA opens multiple avenues for the students. Not just that but it also helps in getting promotions, accepting managerial positions or switching jobs to better opportunities.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:4px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Future after Regular MBA<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Regular MBA or traditional MBA is the most relied upon option for management education. Studies report that <strong>India has the second largest pool of MBA graduates<\/strong>. If the enrollment rate continues to grow at the same speed, then it is expected that India will be ranked at the top. It is beyond doubt that MBA is among the most sought-after courses in the country. It caters to soft skills &amp; industry-oriented skills and deals with real-time project experience. Additionally, most universities in India offer internship opportunities, project work, capstone projects and much more for the students to gain industry experience. This helps the students to bridge the gap between corporate and college, thus making them job-ready.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:4px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Irrespective of the mode of education, an MBA degree is highly lucrative and a valuable addition into your CV.
