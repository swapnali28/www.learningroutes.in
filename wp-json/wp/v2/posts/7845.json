Gone are the days when almost everything was done manually, and now we live in the time where a lot of work is taken over by machines, software, and various automatic processes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before having an insight into what are the benefits of pursuing an <strong><em>M.Sc. in AI and ML from NMIMS<\/em><\/strong>, it is very important for you to have an understanding of what exactly AI and ML is and why you should go for it, or what are the future benefits of AI and ML which can help you foster your career growth. So let&#8217;s start with getting a very basic understanding of what AI and ML is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong><em>Intelligence: \u201cAbility to learn, understand and think\u201d<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Artificial intelligence or AI is nothing but the science of computers and machines developing intelligence like humans. In this technology, the machines are able to do some of the simple to complex stuff that humans need to do on a regular basis. John McCarthy coined the term \u2018Artificial Intelligence\u2019 in the 1950s. He said, \u2018Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions, and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is Machine Learning (ML)?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). Machine learning algorithms allow AI to not only process that data, but to use it to learn and get smarter, without needing any additional programming.&nbsp;With increased data and experience, the results of machine learning are more accurate\u2014much like how humans improve with more practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The adaptability of machine learning makes it a great choice in scenarios where the data is always changing, the nature of the request or task is always shifting, or coding a solution would be effectively impossible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Growing demand of AI and ML<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"678\" height=\"484\" src=\"https:\/\/www.learningroutes.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7846\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.learningroutes.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/image.png 678w, https:\/\/www.learningroutes.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/image-300x214.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no denying the fact that Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are influencing every part of the tech industry. AI and ML are everywhere, from the corporate world to gaming stations, and perhaps, more than our regular lives, AI is impacting the business world more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tech giants like Facebook and Google have placed huge bets on machine learning, and they are already using this technology in their products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is only the beginning. Businesses have seen a massive unraveling of the AI and ML phenomena as they find the possibilities of their application in various fields. For example, researchers started using Machine Learning to gain insights into the recent global pandemic that brought the world to a standstill. Businesses are already on the patch to create more robust virtual work environments leading to heightened demand for AI and ML professionals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>THINKING TO OPT FOR AI AND ML TO STAY UPDATED WITH THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENTS?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>HERE COMES NMIMS TO YOUR RESCUE!<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data is no longer the new oil, it is now the world\u2019s most essential resource for business profitability and innovation. The immeasurable applications of data have created an insatiable demand for skilled professionals who are proficient in tools that drive automation, maximize insights, create lucidity &amp; more from data; over 1 million Artificial Intelligence professionals will be needed by 2021 globally.&nbsp;NMIMS Global along with INSOFE recently announced the launch of a 24-month Master of Science program in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Operations (MS in AI and ML Ops). MS in AI &amp; ML Ops Program will have a strong focus on comprehensive technical training. This will mold students into becoming more competitive professionals. MS in AI &amp; ML Ops introduced by&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.learningroutes.in\/nmims-mba-admission\/\">NMIMS Global<\/a>&nbsp;emphasizes equipping students with the skills to use data to increase insights, generate lucidity and increase efficiency in the tools that operate automation.&nbsp;The program has been designed to provide working executives with the skills necessary to compete in the rapidly growing market for Data Science professionals. Enterprise in the private and public sectors need executives, analysts, and specialists with advanced training in analytics technology as well as business management.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Career Assistance:&nbsp;<\/strong>Career assistance is an integral part of the MS in AI &amp; ML Ops program.
