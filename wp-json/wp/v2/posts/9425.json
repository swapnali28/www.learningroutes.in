R. M. Annamalai Chettiar created Annamalai University, which combines Sri Minakshi College, Sri Minakshi Tamil College, and Sri Minakshi Sanskrit College.

In 2021, Annamalai University is granted the status of affiliating university, and colleges in Villupuram, Cuddalore, Kallakurichi, and Mayiladuthurai are affiliated with the university.

However, if particularly a student is looking for a distance MBA in India or distance MBA in the country, we strongly recommend factors like career advancement services, mentorship, and placement assistance when choosing an distance management program.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With the growing advent of digitization, distance courses particularly distance MBA courses are in vogue and have established themselves, perhaps if not more, but equally valuable to traditional MBA courses.
