Why did this draft not get approval in the previous years? Will foreign universities be given complete autonomy? Are these universities willing to hire Indian professors &amp; teachers? And what does the future of India&#8217;s higher education look like?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:4px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What\u2019s This Noise About Foreign Universities Entering the Indian Market?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/indianexpress.com\/article\/explained\/foreign-universities-india-campus-8366318\/\">UGC report<\/a>, many <strong>\u201cEuropean Countries\u201d<\/strong> are interested in expanding their roots in India. The <strong>University of Birmingham<\/strong> released an official response which said, <em>\u201cWe are always open to opportunities for partnership working. We would also point Indian students toward the excellent study opportunities available at the University of Birmingham in both UK and Dubai.\u201d&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another college that is<strong> King\u2019s College, London has signed MoU with the government of Telangana<\/strong> for collaborative research, staff &amp; student exchange, curriculum development, and upskilling.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These collaborations and the keen interest of foreign universities in Indian institutions is a testimony to the fact that India is an excellent economy to invest in.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:4px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Attracts Foreign Investment in India?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Studies have shown that after the United States, India currently has the second-largest higher education system. Thus, the education sector in our nation has a very high potential for growth. The market for distance education was valued at 39 billion in 2018, and by 2024, it is expected to rise to 360 billion. By the end of 2020, there were more than 988 universities and about 40,000 colleges already established in India.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the AISHE stats, the gross enrollment ratio has grown by 0.8%, with a constant increase of 18.2% in female enrollments. This level of growth necessitates significant financial commitment which is not feasible simply through the government. As a result, it encourages and supports investments from the private sector. Furthermore, it promotes foreign direct investment in the sector.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:4px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The NEP 2020 Vision<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest UGC draft is in line with National Education Policy 2020 (NEP).
