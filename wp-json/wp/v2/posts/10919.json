There are a few important tips that you need to be well aware of in order to crack the interview and impress the employer. Let&#8217;s try to understand the important job etiquettes for an interview that you should keep in mind. These job interview tips will surely help you clear the interview &amp; land your dream job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Research Well About the Company:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It is crucial to research about the company that you want to get in and see whether it suits your aspirations,&nbsp; lifestyle and career goals. You can easily get to know about the company by browsing its website, and social media profiles or by contacting any other professionals who are already working there. The primary things to remember while researching about the company are:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How is the work culture of the company<\/li><li>What are the company\u2019s mission, vision and future goals<\/li><li>What are the reviews given by the working professionals of the company<\/li><li>Leave &amp; increment policies<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:4px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2.<\/strong> <strong>Pay Attention to Your Body Language:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The right body language marks a great first impression on the recruiter and shows your confidence. Thus, you should pay attention to your body language by:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Maintaining eye contact with the recruiter to show that you are attentive in the interview and are not shying away<\/li><li>Keeping a smile on your face while answering the questions in the interview<\/li><li>Listening first and then answering by taking a short pause<\/li><li>Practise your body language in front of the mirror before the interview<\/li><li>Showing your enthusiasm by making good expressions &amp; gestures<\/li><li>Being punctual for the interview, and responding to emails proactively<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:4px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&nbsp;<strong>3. Greet the Interviewer Decently:&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFirst impression is the last impression.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your gesture before the interviewer makes a great impact in posing a good impression. While greeting the interviewer, you should shake hands confidently, use formal language, and maintain eye contact. The way you greet the recruiter can make a lasting impression.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:4px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Don&#8217;t Reflect that You are Here for the Salary:&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It is obvious that everyone aspires to get a good salary while switching jobs. But you should remember to not emphasise your salary expectations repeatedly during the interview, as it tends to make a not-so-good impression of you and can make the recruiter feel that you are here only for the salary.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recruiter should feel that you are more excited about the job role and company than the salary. You should also remember to not give a number and instead present your demanded salary range.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:4px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Pay Extra Attention to Communication Skills:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>From introducing yourself to ending the interview, all that matters is how well you communicate throughout. Keep your tone polite and speak with good command of the language with jargon of the job profile. Many people have a good command of English but tend to not speak out properly when facing an interview. But do not worry. You can easily fix your speaking skills with these simple tips:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Be well prepared and rehearse near the mirror to reduce your anxiety\u00a0<\/li><li>Listen carefully first and then answer with a polite tone\u00a0<\/li><li>Be concise and clear on what to say<\/li><li>Use confident body language<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:4px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Exhibit a Balance of IQ and EQ:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Answering the basic questions about your skills and experience is easy; but many times the recruiter may ask you emotional or tricky questions like- \u2018Tell me about a time when you handled a tough situation?\u2019 or \u2018What success means to you?\u2019 This is where you are likely to go blank and may not know what to answer spontaneously.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These EQ and IQ-based questions are deliberately asked by the recruiter to judge your abilities and to know what kind of person you are, and if you can be the right fit for the job demands. They purposely want to check your mental and emotional ability to handle situations &amp; people. Therefore you need to keep a balance of both in order to prove yourself as the right fit for the job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:4px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Be Prepared to Talk About Your Future Goals:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It is very likely that the recruiter will ask you this question- \u2018Where do you see yourself in the next 5 years?\u2019 This is among the most frequently asked questions in interviews. The main motive for asking this question is that the recruiter wants to know about your future career goals and how ambitious you are to achieve those goals.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The appropriate way to answer this question is to keep your ambitions in line with the company\u2019s vision &amp; growth. Just try to be specific about your career goals and show that you also want to stick with the hiring company for a long term. This will pose a good impression of you. Instead, if you answer that you want to start your own venture in the near future, you might be rejected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:4px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>8. Dress Appropriately:\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Dressing well in the interview is an important step in building a good impression. It is good if you try not to dress casually and wear formal and professional clothes which will indicate that you are serious about the interview. Here are a few tips to dress up nicely in the interview:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Wear formal pants, dress or shirts in black, navy blue or grey colours<\/li><li>Keep your hair tied neatly and your nails trimmed. Present yourself so that you look clean<\/li><li>Wear limited or no jewellery or fancy things.<\/li><li>Wearing a watch shows that you\u2019re an organised person.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:4px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&nbsp;<strong>9. Accept a Glass of Water, Tea or Coffee:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It is likely that the recruiter may offer you some water, tea or a cup of coffee. You should never shy away from accepting what they offer. By doing so you get a short moment to calm yourself down, and the interviewer also feels like a good host, making the interview comfortable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:4px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>10. Prepare Some Intelligent Questions to Ask the Interviewer:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the interview it is good if you try to ask some intelligent questions that you might be curious to know. After all, it&#8217;s not just about finding if you are the right fit for the company, it&#8217;s also important to know whether the company is right for you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few questions that can be asked to the recruiter are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What are the next steps in the interview process?<\/li><li>What are the challenges in this job role?<\/li><li>Who will be there in your team, &amp; what is the hierarchy?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:6px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Dos and Don\u2019ts in an Interview\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><th> <strong>Dos\u00a0<\/strong> <\/th><th><strong>Don\u2019ts<\/strong><\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Dress Professionally&nbsp;<\/td><td>Don\u2019t Act too Casual&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Don\u2019t be Late<\/td><td>Don\u2019t Falsify Your Application\/ Resume&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Be an Active Listener&nbsp;<\/td><td>Don\u2019t Exhibit Frustration or Desperation&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Have Some Questions Prepared Beforehand<\/td><td>Keep Away from Your Phone and Other Devices&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Research About the Company Beforehand<\/td><td>Don\u2019t Exhibit Bad Body Posture<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Pay Extra Attention to Your Body Language<\/td><td>Don&#8217;t Make the Interviewer Guess Your Interests&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:3px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Takeaway\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Presenting yourself as a confident &amp; right candidate for the job is highly imperative.
