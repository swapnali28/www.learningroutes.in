YES? Have a read then.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In India, a wave takes over after every 3-4 years. Once, everyone was on their way to becoming doctors and engineers, then everyone shifted toward management, and for over a decade now there is a common trend of doing MBA after B.Tech which is doing wonders for pass-outs and their employers and there seems no end to this movement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The employees who carry this combination are happy as they are getting great job opportunities in big companies and the employers are giving them preference because they get a combination of both the skills in employee technology and managing. So, it is a win-win situation for both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An <strong>MBA course<\/strong> in India gives a lot of scope, not only in the private sector but also in government sectors like banking, railways, teaching, information technology, agriculture, sports, airlines, healthcare, and more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:7px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Some Insight into the MBA colleges in India&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Specifications<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Information&nbsp;<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>No. of colleges that offer Masters of Business Administration&nbsp;<\/td><td>Almost 5000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tuition Fee<\/td><td>6% of the colleges &lt; 10 lacs&nbsp;94% of the colleges&gt;10 lacs&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Exams required&nbsp;<\/td><td>CAT, MAT, XAT, CMAT, NMAT, ATMA, SNAP<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Popular Specializations&nbsp;<\/td><td>Finance, Human Resources, Information Technology (IT), Logistics, Marketing, Business, Rural, Health Care Management, Operations, Event Management<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Top colleges&nbsp;<\/td><td>IIM(All branches), XLRI Jamshedpur, MDI Gurgaon, IMI, SPJIMR, IMT, VIT, Fore School of Management&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are also one of those who is looking forward to shifting into administration after your engineering, here are <strong>5 benefits of an MBA-<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1<strong>. More salary<\/strong> &#8211; <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>One major advantage of choosing this course after B.Tech is that the salaries offered are high and this is the reason why most of the students are making this choice. Engineers get an opportunity to advance their careers with this degree. Anybody who is a Master&#8217;s in Business Administration after doing a B.Tech course can easily get 7-8LPA as freshers and the package keeps on increasing as the experience increases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One also gets the chance of career progression and can easily reach senior positions which also gives rise in salaries as managing a group of people is a difficult task and requires a lot of time and energy and this is why you can ask for greater packages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:2px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. <strong>Great option for future entrepreneurs &#8211;<\/strong> <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For anybody who is looking forward to their own business someday, doing a course in Masters of Business Administration is the best option as it incorporates skills like managing money, planning, effective organization, and execution. Many aspiring entrepreneurs feel stuck at a point in their businesses, the practical knowledge you gained from your course will help you overcome such difficulties. You will be well versed with the efficient operation of a firm and you can apply the same. On the whole, management after engineering will prepare you for a business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:2px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. <strong>Develops overall personality-<\/strong> <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a graduate in Technology, you already have the intelligence and dedication in you. Doing an MBA after that will help you in your overall growth and you will become a complete package. Any student who is pursuing this study&nbsp; goes under intensive training during their course as a part of their curriculum which helps in building one such personality which reflects qualities like problem-solving, decision-making, managerial, and analytical abilities. It also helps in improving communication skills which are really helpful once you start working professionally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:2px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4<strong>. Better Career Opportunities<\/strong>&#8211;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A student who goes for an <strong>MBA course<\/strong> after pursuing B.Tech is often promised top-tier placement after the course. It is a broad profession with a vast variety of specializations as compared to M.Tech and this is the reason that an individual has a varied variety of career options after doing an MBA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The study covers a wide range of topics, including business, finance, human resources, statistics, economics, and even health. This broadens your professional alternatives and broadens your horizons. With such exposure, you can easily expect top jobs in big companies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:2px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5<strong>. Flexibility and convenience<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It is only with an MBA degree that you get the opportunity to work and earn at the same time as the course allows you to do your job and studies simultaneously. There are many leading institutes that give the option of distance MBA courses to ambitious individuals. NMIMS is one of them. The institute is the top and the leading education provider that gives <a href=\"https:\/\/www.learningroutes.in\/nmims-distance-mba\/\"><strong>distance MBA<\/strong><\/a><strong> <\/strong>&nbsp;with flexible hours and gives various facilities as per the convenience of the candidate. Such courses help to enhance the skills and provide value to the profile of a student. MBA is way more convenient in comparison to a post-graduation in Engineering. As in B.Tech, a student has to go through extensive study schedules, and doing the same along with training is quite hectic. On the contrary, MBA is way easier and offers better placements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:7px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are the eligibility criteria for getting into MBA?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Students in India who want to pursue an MBA after engineering must pass common management exams including the CAT, MAT, CET, XAT, and SNAP. Group talks and a round of personal interviews come next. Other examinations, such as the GMAT and GRE, are acceptable to apply for admission in international nations. The requirements also include work experience, which differs amongst universities. For those who want to enrol in this course right after they complete their graduation, there are several universities that do not require work experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/3pi7rfgOOw6X2ESo0-CiB-Uclq69jPV0jg5K4lz_lGM9h23HzUiAOD67pnUv8Zc3P19LqIx5EMCQ4KYD_9ZkN5i9aJ2yX5KxItlfIJtL4w9RflNNR5ULXVsPbiXEXMsF2-T8zJ4NxtC12WHaZ4a_i5I\" alt=\"Top 5 benefits of MBA after Engineering\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:7px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Top Jobs after MBA<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1<strong>.
