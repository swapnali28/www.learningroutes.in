And the Budget 2023 is a significant step towards this goal as it aims to bring substantial changes to the education sector.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, the budget outlines many primary and higher education initiatives, allocation of research and innovation funds, and addresses the need for improved school infrastructure. This article will provide a brief overview of the education budget for 2023 and its impact on the education sector in India.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:5px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Budget 2023 Allocation for the Education Sector<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A robust education sector is crucial for a nation&#8217;s growth. In India, every child between the ages of 6 to 14 has a constitutional right to free and compulsory education under various articles. However, education has not been a priority for the central or state governments, as it falls under the concurrent list of the Indian Constitution.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the Covid-19 pandemic has significantly impacted India&#8217;s education system, with schools and colleges being closed for nearly 20 months, leading to a dismal state of affairs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kothari Commission in 1964 advised raising education spending to 6% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Despite this recommendation, over the past five decades, the education budget in the country has always remained within 3.5% of the GDP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As per the Economic Survey 2021-22, the combined expenditure on education by the central and state governments has remained at 2.8% of GDP from 2014-20. However, due to the impact of the pandemic, this figure rose to 3.1% through 2020-22.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, the total spending on education is 2.9% of the nation&#8217;s GDP. The education budget this year saw a considerable rise, with a record allocation of \u20b91.12 lakh crore, an 8% increase from last year&#8217;s 1.04 lakh crore budget allocation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:5px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Highlights of India\u2019s Education Budget 2023<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The pandemic-related lockdowns have significantly impacted India&#8217;s school children, leading to loss of years of education for many students, particularly in government schools and rural areas.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After three years of disruption, the education sector is eager for a fresh start, with the government placing a focus on upskilling the youth and increasing digitization. As a result, the highest-ever allocation for the education sector of INR 1.12 lakh crore ($13.66 Bn) was announced in the Union Budget 2023-24.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The allocation for school education has increased by 8% from INR 63,449 crore ($7.74 Bn) in 2022-23 to INR 68,804 crore ($8.39 Bn) in 2023-24. While higher education has been allotted INR 44,094 crore in 2023-24, as opposed to INR 40,828 crore in 2022-23, indicating a 7.9% increase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><\/td><td>2022-23<\/td><td>2023-24<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>School Education<\/td><td>INR 63,449 crore<\/td><td>INR 68,804 crore<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Higher Education<\/td><td>INR 40,828 crore<\/td><td>INR 44,094 crore<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, unveiled a series of measures to address the growing education disparities.

And so, the current focus on hiring many teachers and developing a sustainable training programme via innovative methods, curriculum transformation, professional development, and ICT implementation will significantly enhance the quality of education in Indian schools.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Empowering young people through nationwide apprenticeship programmes like the PM Kaushal Vikas Yojana 4.0, will offer promising career prospects.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The budget also announces 30 new Skill India International Centers to offer cutting-edge programmes in coding, AI, IOT, mechatronics, and drones and enhance soft skills. This is a phenomenal initiative for the growth and advancement of vocational education in the education sector.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A major achievement of this budget is the creation of a National Digital Library for children and young people, offering high-quality resources in multiple languages. This will boost the government&#8217;s efforts to promote digital learning in rural and remote areas and contribute to India&#8217;s goal of becoming a tech powerhouse in the coming years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.learningroutes.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/education-budget-2023-1.jpeg\" alt=\"education-budget-2023\" class=\"wp-image-11061\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With an 8% increase in educational allocation, this year&#8217;s budget focuses on upskilling the youth and increasing digitization while addressing education disparities.
