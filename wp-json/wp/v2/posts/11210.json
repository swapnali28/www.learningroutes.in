After the platform was taken over by Elon Musk, there have been many changes introduced to it. There have been lots of controversies around Twitter that have made significant headlines in the papers. Elon, the man behind the Twitter transformation, is wrapped around controversies. Recently, he has added yet another squabble to this list by replacing the Twitter website logo out of the blue. Yes, you heard it correctly, Mush has replaced the blue bird with a dog. And not just any dog, but the dog from the infamous \u2018Doge Meme\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, #TwitterLogo is trending with more than 10K tweets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But why did Musk do it? When did he do it? Is it some kind of a new prank or an April Fool\u2019s joke?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you curious?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So are we!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s explore possible reasons behind this change and its impact on the crypto world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:6px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Happened?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/By_6m2x_bN67y0T4FIQivt3146tdHzjvR_AB7o9hfhJlNotzCgUYHUWmeeHSf1yRuUjFF4wWSVCbBQH8RO380XcipQd-eKoia8RmWRKcgMfwTX8E_49Fd4VfjXcvGvlnGXBLNgHk3NDDZQBz_7QL2uc\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:3px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>On April 4th, at 12:20 AM, Elon Musk, Twitter\u2019s current boss, posted this meme on his Twitter handle. Soon Twitter\u2019s logo changed to the image of a dog. But this only happened on the Twitter web platform, not on the mobile application. Furthermore, not just any dog, but the famous dog meme \u201cDoge\u201d. Moreover, you must have heard about dogecoin, a cryptocurrency and a strong rival for Bitcoin and Ethereum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone started to assume it was just a late April Fool&#8217;s prank or he was yet again trying to bring about a surge in the price of DogeCoin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:6px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What\u2019s Elon\u2019s Reason?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Elon Musk, the billionaire, philanthropist and Tesla owner, is unpredictable. He does whatever he wants, whenever he feels like.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One fine morning, when you wake up and see a dog instead of a bird on Twitter, you start thinking what might be the possible explanation?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elon posted a follow-up tweet where he mentioned about keeping an old promise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have a look at it:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/zH077b2Uzncx1nwaVieFhagIyEA_-cDZ_ATvjzpry6dkntY9HotC4wbVD1VqlRiRgplDIeWpVPwsO1iLZS56nYm-f2f_IlemfaVNdtutPpOVP5tr82t2cwyxH_nCmSQA9BEiVhhS-XbFqgMC34Dfs88\" alt=\"\" width=\"266\" height=\"303\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:4px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>A Twitter user \u201cChairman\u201d suggested Elon to buy Twitter and change its bird logo to a doge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He posted, \u201cAs promised,\u201d with the screenshot of the old thread.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now people are speculating that there might be another reason behind this change: to promote and boost the value of Dogecoin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:6px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is a Dogecoin?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dogecoin or Shiba Inu coin was created as a simple and light alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin is abundant, and more than 10,000 new coins are mined every minute.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Dogecoin has a substantial significance among memers. It is like a meme coin that is loved by its community. Dogecoin is not owned by anyone. However, notable personalities like Mark Cuban, Snoop Dog and Elon Musk have expressed their interest in Dogecoin.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to this change, the price of Dogecoin has increased by almost 30% over the past few days.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:6px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Lawsuit Against Elon<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, Dogecoin investors filed a lawsuit against musk, accusing him of driving its price to an all-time high only to let the price fall. Musk\u2019s lawyer defended giving the argument that those tweets about dogecoin were innocuous and silly. Furthermore, it states that his words, such as \u201cDogecoin Rulz\u201d, and \u201cNo highs, no lows, only Doge\u201d, were too vague to claim fraud.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiple investors felt they had incurred massive losses by investing in dogecoin, and Elon was the reason behind it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, Musk asked a federal judge to drop the $258 billion lawsuit against him as his tweets were just for fun.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:6px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Doge Effect<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/-7IeMqoYg919QeESS7B0K8MPAZdyfLKi6RcIXpWEcRz9E9Pxoyezz_AiUn7LjmrrB8TswJTquqFWHwh6T8WR6CbbBUoHqIc1me2_f7c4vCC6uAs7bCD3FAtNYxSRQpauTLfJOa0EXJDgApJ1l0JAj9w\" alt=\"\" width=\"395\" height=\"296\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Shiba Inu effect or the Doge effect is a concern for many. When we see doge, we get the idea of the meme, and we tend to laugh. People are concerned about Twitter becoming a joke. After Elon\u2019s takeover, Twitter has seen some rough days; from firing half of its workforce to a buggy feed, it has seen all. Users were upset about the slow performance, monetisation of the blue tick and much more. The sudden pop-up of doge instead of the bluebird is a bit of concern for many. Some speculate that the dog is just a late April fool prank that Musk forgot to pull.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is undebatable that Twitter, after the Musk takeover, is not the same. Elon keeps on altering it and introduces something new every day. Within this short time, he has made more than ten changes to the platform, including changing its logo to Doge. This shows his affection for Doge and how badly he wants to promote it. He wants Doge to overtake Bitcoin and make the coin rule the crypto world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, popular brands are engaging in this doge effect and posting various memes related to these changes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few memes made by RealMe:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/9tfL_mIsvAknU11DbBx4_XVjlrrWIu0cqtPRJua3TBtN3GbsU4cj-VGiozSoCU3qBLfXS05iT_JEpigGMfk5nfpTXODM0XFMeiX6c2BM3Bq64502lZvZKhrcZBpX9b6ad6lzDzrH2NDTt7oMAcdFOtE\" alt=\"\" width=\"418\" height=\"418\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:6px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/QAVEhX7MwMPJqCqJ1UTy47Fd1_7iMZ8iKgYZlGZYHKUhSW6SQH7TNYGDn7Wgqpswan1Q6KQFYERVFLa4FG4Ojd9UKSGvHvYgECPuwqcc7H7diwL1LdWJRkpYlRxUww6JRf135Ea-UF9HC2nc-wkgNEg\" alt=\"\" width=\"474\" height=\"284\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:6px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Takeaway<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, Elon Musk&#8217;s Twitter icon change to the Doge meme has caused quite a stir among Twitter users and Dogecoin investors. While some speculate that it is just a late April Fool&#8217;s prank, others believe that it is a strategic move by Musk to promote Dogecoin and boost its value. Regardless of his reasons, one thing is sure: Musk&#8217;s unpredictability and willingness to take risks have once again made headlines and sparked conversations. Only time will tell if the Doge effect will have a lasting impact on Twitter and the crypto world.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When you look at this meme, what do you see?
