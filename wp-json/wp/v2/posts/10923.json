Let&#8217;s discuss what else matters to the recruiters while hand-picking a candidate:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"900\" height=\"230\" src=\"https:\/\/www.learningroutes.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/resume-cover-letter-of-recommendation-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10925\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.learningroutes.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/resume-cover-letter-of-recommendation-1.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.learningroutes.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/resume-cover-letter-of-recommendation-1-300x77.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.learningroutes.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/resume-cover-letter-of-recommendation-1-768x196.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Cover Letter<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A cover letter is like a personalised application letter that you send along with your resume.

LOR plays a vital role in getting a job as it shows and tells the recruiter about you by a credible third person (internship manager, college professor, HOD or any senior professional).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:4px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4.
