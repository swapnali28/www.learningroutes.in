According to IBEF, the education sector in India was&nbsp; valued atUS $117 billion in the year 2020 and is forecasted to reach approximately US $225 billion in 2025.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Indian Edtech market size is expected to reach US$ 30 billion by 2031. <\/strong>The credit for the same goes not only to traditional mode of studies but also to skill-based open &amp; distance learning courses. <strong>According to KPMG, India has the second largest e-education sector after the US.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Indian Government has taken various initiatives to empower and inculcate practicality.

Most universities offer distance courses night classes or weekend classes. This mode can also be called a hybrid mode.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ODL courses are specially designed while keeping working professionals in mind so that they can continue their job or business while upskilling on the side. In this mode, the students can interact with the teachers for doubts or exam queries and also with their fellow mates in an offline setting. However, they can also avail the option of self-paced learning.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/y3i6mMRzojvxgNr4Gq4ze0d8r-npVQvRUXUHYTKSYPXlAHargqBto1_ka7onYMruTdbLkmu6e5mlo1igVsNhI3DmB6rX0rVr_t0OgmEXfu4SJkJtr0PSoID6f4PAJl8_npICpAatxSTz8Wf2cGgK19oHDNYeb8X55ekx9kHXeuZb_eZ0O4Jv76L0j2qy\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:4px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pre-Requisites for Choosing an ODL course<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The trick to leveraging ODL courses is to keep a few critical pre-requisites in mind.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first and foremost thing to keep in mind is choosing an institute. This decision can make or break your career. The integral component while considering your institute should be<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Course Specializations<\/li><li>Tuition Fee<\/li><li>Accreditations<\/li><li>Networking Opportunities&nbsp;<\/li><li>Placement Assistance&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing you should consider while opting for a distance course is the institute&#8217;s location. It is impractical to opt for a course from a university that is far away from your location because that will affect the time, lifestyle, and transportation cost you wanted to avoid with a full-time course.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:4px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why Should You Choose an ODL Course?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we have discovered the scope of part-time courses and established the pre-requisites that should be taken care of, it is time to validate the fact and understand why you should opt for this mode of education.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most significant advantages of ODL mode of learning is the ability to balance your studies with your work or family obligations. Distance education allows you the freedom to combine the two aspects of your life, as well as the financial benefits of being able to continue working while still funding your studies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some added benefits are &#8211;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. If you are already in a job, then ODL courses can help you get a promotion&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. It can help you expand your job options<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. You can make a transition to your job in a field that you want to work in<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. You can cut down the transportation cost, living expenses, and miscellaneous costs&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5.

Do students get the same packages as those who are full-time students? Are there any globally recognised universities in India that offer distance courses?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are some of the questions that immediately popped up when we talked about the distance mode.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, the answer is, \u201cYes, you can find all the opportunities.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though the idea of ODL courses is not that popular, the job opportunities are not limited.
