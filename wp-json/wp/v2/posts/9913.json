Nearly 14 percent of B-School applicants selected India as their top preference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Indian School of Business was the first institution to offer an Executive MBA in India<\/strong>, and the IIMs shortly followed with added benefits. These MBA programs are created with working professionals, executives, high-end managers, and CEOs in mind. Industry managers, professionals, and executives can develop their abilities by following the curriculum.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:12px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is the difference between a distance MBA and an executive MBA?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aspirants generally misunderstand a distance executive MBA course as any other distance MBA. Here are <strong>3 key differences<\/strong> between the two: &#8211;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The duration of an executive MBA is a minimum of 1 year and can be exceeded to as many years as the university wants but on the other hand distance MBA is restricted to 2 years.&nbsp;<\/li><li>An executive course is a general managerial course and very rarely any specialization is included but it is common in the case of distance courses to include specializations. Institutes like Narsee Monjee offer 10 industry-oriented specializations.&nbsp;<\/li><li>The main aim of an executive MBA is to expand the network rather than prioritize the placement opportunities but the latter is chosen so as to offer placement assistance which is its main USP.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:12px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Advantages of an online Executive MBA course: &#8211;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. <strong>Online Courses &#8211; an opportunity to multitask&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest advantage of online courses is that students can do simultaneous things along with their courses. Working professionals are especially inclined towards such courses. <strong>Reports have suggested that in the year 2020, the online education market was reported to be INR 91.41 billion<\/strong> big.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:7px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. <strong>Sponsored by MNCs<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Not a lot of people are aware of the fact that, if a working professional wants to pursue an executive course their company either offers to pay them for the course or gives them a sabbatical thus helping them to upskill and take higher and responsible roles.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:7px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. <strong>Pursuing Benefits&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only the course is beneficial after completion, but aspirants also get promotions just because they are taking such a course from top business schools in India. In such cases the aspirants get threefold benefits: &#8211;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Promotion based on pursuing the course&nbsp;<\/li><li>Upskilled both professionals and academically&nbsp;<\/li><li>Promotions after course completion&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:7px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Practical Implementation<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The main purpose of a distance executive program is to inculcate managerial and entrepreneurial skills. This course trains individuals to aim for higher positions in their organizations. The curriculum of an executive course is embedded with case studies, interactive courses, and add-ons. Such diverse methods help the students to learn these skills and also apply them simultaneously in their current job roles.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:7px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Easy Admission Procedure&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly, as much as this course is a value addition <a href=\"https:\/\/www.learningroutes.in\">enrollment in online courses<\/a> is also easy. Institutes like Narsee Monjee take interviews to enrol students in their executive programs. There are no entrance exams or marks barriers, the admissions are based on experience, knowledge, and personality check.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:7px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Less Fee but More Value&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As compared to a regular course, an online executive course is highly beneficial because the fee structure of a regular course begins with 8 lakhs but an online course can be completed in half the amount that too from India\u2019s top B-School.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:12px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">List of Skills developed in an online Executive Course<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Ethics and Social Responsibility<\/td><td>Decision Making<\/td><td>Networking&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Soft Skills&nbsp;<\/td><td>Communication&nbsp;<\/td><td>Leadership and Teamwork&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Investment management<\/td><td>Business research<\/td><td>Strategic brand management<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:12px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Disadvantages of an online Executive MBA course: &#8211;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. <strong>Lack of Time Management<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>An executive program is a hefty course irrespective of the mode of education and thus requires time, effort, and devotion. To succeed in online learning, students must find a method to combine the freedom of the medium with a strict and realistic timetable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:7px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. <strong>Non &#8211; Seriousness&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Since admission to these courses is comparatively easy hence the students may take it for granted. The flexibility and convenience of online classes might be advantageous for self-disciplined students, but for those who lack motivation or discipline, the absence of a formal framework can be a trap. You don&#8217;t have a set meeting time, and you don&#8217;t connect with professors and classmates on a regular basis in a way that might push you to work better. Lack of self-discipline among online students can result in missed deadlines for assignments, inadequate preparation for exams, and failure to take the initiative to contact professors by phone or email, all of which can negatively affect their academic performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:7px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. <strong>International Opportunities&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Institutes like ISB offer international opportunities but that is only for the students who have enrolled for regular courses. The biggest disadvantage of online courses is that institutes can not offer them direct placement assistance due to UGC guidelines hence the students lack international placement opportunities.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:7px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. <strong>Students are always mentally occupied<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Establishing boundaries is a difficult task especially when everything is online. To make a transition between online classes and online pleasure time is difficult because of excess dopamine release. This does not allow the brain to process and slow down things and also makes a severe impact on the eyes. However flexible and convenient online education might be but it takes a toll on the individual\u2019s health.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/1K2aXypTbuCBz1hPMUk08ZpvofwWdfhmG7NqLJ8pVapdEa_t9MLwAlqIOns1dRe8LJSn1GKWU6xp7ugYgSgeV3d3MCUUhViPNLsK15neXrmtlCPJu7mA_SOo0qP5Tub5Bb-o2EDmz7P_gTfOHw\" alt=\"Benefits of Executive MBA\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A research conducted by <strong>Pew Research Center research in August 2011, 77% of college supervisors said their institutions provided online courses.<\/strong> The demand from students and the benefits for colleges in providing online education has helped the E-learning industry expand. Nevertheless, despite its benefits, some of the learning downsides might be difficult for students to deal with if they lack the appropriate online learning abilities.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>According to a poll conducted by the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC), 19% of applicants in India now choose to apply to an Executive MBA program over a conventional MBA program.
