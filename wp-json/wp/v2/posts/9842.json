This is a highly competitive and quantitative field due to high-paying jobs.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students who choose to specialize in finance in their MBA program will study topics including Cost &amp; Management Accounting, Taxation, Capital Market and Portfolio Management, Corporate Finance, and International Finance among other critical subject matters in the domain.ICIC Bank, HDFC Bank, American Express, Accenture, TATA, JP Morgan, and other corporates are among the organizations that hire MBA graduates with a focus on finance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An MBA in Operations is very useful for professionals because operations are the foundation of any organization. For both manufacturing and service companies, you will learn how to maximize corporate resources, create process flows, plan production, construct supply chains and logistics, manage suppliers, monitor quality control, and achieve continual operational efficiency improvement. Since operations specialists serve as the centre of a business, these positions also determine managerial and leadership skills, which an MBA helps students acquire.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Operations management, service and production planning, inventory management, supply chain management, and quality management are just a few of the topics covered in an MBA with a speciality in operations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marketing Management is yet another popular specialization, with the rise in social media and digitization students prefer to opt for it and the market demand has also risen with time. Marketing included both analytical and creative capabilities giving the students a holistic platform to showcase their skills. Not only the course is based on hard core course-based skills or theories but soft skills are an important parameter.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some other specializations in NMIMS distance courses are also preferred by the students such as International Trade which helps the students to understand foreign relations better and how they can build their careers abroad. Another expert course is Information Technology and Systems Management which is generally preferred by Engineering and Science students given that they already have a background in it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:7px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Current Packages in India in the NMIMS\u2019s former specializations<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Students are generally worried if they will get equal placement assistance as is offered to regular students.
