Open AI and their new product- ChatGPT has been the talk of the town for the past few weeks. It has been increasingly trending on Twitter and has reached a massive user base within just a few days leaving behind Instagram and TikTok.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where Netflix took 3.5 years and Instagram took 2.5 months to reach a user base of 1 million, ChatGPT only took 5 days to reach an enormous client base of 10 lakhs around the globe. It is the fastest-growing technology that will reshape the entire world in the near future.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:6px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Is ChatGPT?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT is an influential AI chatbot system that was developed by one of the most powerful players in the market named Open AI. It is a powerful chatbot that engages with the consumer in an interactive manner which makes the platform quite user-friendly. It facilitates conversations with robots in plain English using an upgraded version of AI systems. ChatGPT has made content generation quite easy and feasible for people whether they are students or working professionals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT can also perform several other tasks that can be listed as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It can write complex essays and articles, irrespective of the subject<\/li><li>It corrects the grammar and usage<\/li><li>It helps in summarising different texts into simple concepts, thus making them user-friendly<\/li><li>It answers follow-up questions in a dialogue format<\/li><li>It admits its mistakes<\/li><li>It challenges the incorrect premises<\/li><li>It even rejects inappropriate requests<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe Times\u201d newspaper in the UK describes ChatGPT as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Stunningly lifelike conversational language system,<\/li><li>World\u2019s first truly useful Chatbot.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, the ChatGPT software has been extensively trained by Artificial Intelligence as well as Machine Learning.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:6px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How ChatGPT Works?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT is a generative pre-trained transformer that allows you to get everything you are looking for in a simple chatbox. The models have the capacity to carry a lot of baggage in terms of texts and a whole lot of information. This means that you can ask anything and everything related to anyone and everyone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These models perform the task of natural language processing quite efficiently. The GPT-3 model is quite large and is 175 billion parameters in size.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT is trained with large swaths of knowledge, text, information, articles, etc. which is then read and understood by it. From this text, the model carries out the natural language processing tasks and provides a response that is comprehensive, grammatically sound, and without any typos.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance,&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You prompt the program with a word, sentence, phrase, query, etc. It can be \u201cWrite me a poem\u201d or \u201cTell me the chemical name of salt\u201d.<\/li><li>Then in the blink of an eye, the program responds to you with the answer to your queries.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:6px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>ChatGpt and Transformer-Based Technique<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Transformation is basically the processing of data that is performed on a sequence of elements like the number of words in a sentence and the number of characters in a word. ChatGPT is based on the transformer architecture as discussed above which is performed using transformations and attention. It is very useful for performing natural language processing tasks and has made them comparatively easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:6px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Applications of ChatGPT<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being an interactive and advanced AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT has made many tasks easier for people all around the world. ChatGPT has innumerable applications as it has become a go-to solution for many businesses. Some of its major applications can be discussed as follows-<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:3px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Code- Writing and Debugging<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing codes for certain problems is undeniably a difficult task and then debugging them for finding mistakes is even more difficult. But then we have no worries about the same, as ChatGPT comes in handy which will write the code for you and can also infer any debugs by the codes written by you.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:3px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Customised Content<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The content available to the users is quite personalised. It is based on the needs and requirements of the users that are operating it. For example, students can solve their maths problems and can also write essays using the ChatGPT.\u00a0 Similarly, working professionals or businesses can use it for writing emails, social media posts, product requirements, business proposals, tenders, etc.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:3px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Content Generation<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many businesses need to create content and texts on a regular basis. Sometimes they need to generate social media posts to increase their reach while other times they might have certain job vacancies at their offices. The content for all this is generated by the comprehensive platform ChatGPT, a one-stop solution for many problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:3px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Problem-Solving<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT is a genius at solving innumerable problems of its users. It can structure an unstructured data set, helps in enhancing your creativity, and helps you in brainstorming ideas so that you can go with the best one. Therefore, the problem-solving application of ChatGPT has made lives comparatively easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:3px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Sentiment Analysis<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT is an ideal tool to analyse the sentiments of the texts. It can be very useful to monitor customer activities, their feedback, and their responses to the company\u2019s products and services. It can be a useful tool for the organisation as it would help them to make improvements and cover the loopholes if any.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:3px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Language Translation<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT is a useful AI tool that even facilitates language translation. It can be an invaluable asset to companies that have been operating in multiple regions. It has already worked wonders for companies that have a large customer base.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:6px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Limitations of ChatGPT<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every coin has two sides. ChatGPT has certain limitations to its use which can be discussed as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Unable to Provide Legal and Medical Advice:<\/strong> ChatGPT cannot give prescriptions on the basis of someone\u2019s medical condition. Also, the platform cannot provide legal counselling to people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Lacks Emotional Abilities:<\/strong> ChatGPT is not able to experience emotions such as empathy, motivation, etc. which may limit its ability to answer questions that require the display of certain emotions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Limitations with Maths and Science:<\/strong> ChatGPT cannot solve complex Maths and Science problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Biassed Responses:<\/strong> ChatGPT may generate biassed responses on the basis of the training that was provided to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:6px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Implications of ChatGPT<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT has certain implications which can be discussed as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Educational Implications:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both students and teachers are using ChatGPT to lower their workload. The students are using the valuable tool to write their assignments and tests, they even write their exams using ChatGPT. On the other hand, teachers are using the tool to write their lesson plans, e-mails to the parents, formal letters, and whatnot!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This came to light when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kippsocal.org\/news-and-stories\/blog\/1630312\/educational-implications-of-chatgpt\">New York<\/a> became the first state to ban ChatGPT at their schools.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Cybersecurity:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT may produce phishing emails and viruses, which can lead to cybersecurity issues for its users.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Junior Developers are at Risk:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since code snippets can be copied from ChatGPT, this limits the response of their own brains as everything would be available to them with a click of the mouse.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:6px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is ChatGPT Free to Use?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to increase the customer base of the AI-based chatbot, the platform has been provided for free to its users by simply registering on Open AI\u2019s website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, ChatGPT won\u2019t stay free to use for a long period of time. Open AI has introduced a pilot ChatGPT plus subscription plan that costs around $20\/month. The paid option gives you access to extra benefits such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Priority access in busy times<\/li><li>Quicker responses<\/li><li>Exclusive access to the latest elements\u00a0<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:6px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Competitors<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.learningroutes.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/chargpt-vs-bard-1.webp\" alt=\"chatgpt-vs-bard\" class=\"wp-image-11097\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent times, the toughest competitor of ChatGPT is Bard by Google. Bard is a powerful Artificial Intelligence technology that understands natural language processing tasks and responds in an intelligent way to the questions of its users.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from this Bard can perform various other tasks that can be listed as follows-<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. It helps to create interesting stories<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. It creates interactive online games<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. It can even produce audio recordings in response to queries<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Bard is still in the testing process and is currently available to a group of \u201ctrusted testers\u201d, according to Google CEO Sundar Pichai.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from Bard, there are certain other competitors such as Bloom, Sphere, Palm, etc.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:6px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bard vs ChatGPT: The Talk of the Town<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Both, Bard by Google and ChatGPT by OpenAI are technologies that are capable of taking the world by storm with their powerful AI systems. Both of them are in their testing phases, however, ChatGPT has been made open to the public but Google\u2019s Bard is still not made available to users.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bard faced an instant backlash when the software shared a wrong piece of information in a promotional event in a blunder that cost the company $100 billion in market value on 8th February 2023.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:6px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Takeaway<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Artificial Intelligence technologies and systems have become a controversial issue with the increase in digitalisation and innovation. ChatGPT is undoubtedly going to take the world to the next level in the coming future. It certainly has some loopholes and makes mistakes as a human being has, but at the same time, it will make the lives of people comparatively easier as most of the tasks would be completed just with a click of the mouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cIt is not that we use technology, we live technology\u201d, is an apt citation by Godfrey Reggio as it has been continuously demonstrated by an ever-increasing evolution of technology all over the world.
