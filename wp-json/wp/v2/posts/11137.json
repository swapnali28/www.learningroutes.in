These factors include investment, financing, dividend, and Liquidity Decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u2022Financing Decisions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A Financial Manager must decide how to obtain sufficient funds to meet the firm&#8217;s requirements. This involves determining the appropriate balance between equity and debt, known as the firm&#8217;s capital structure. As a Financial Manager, you must strive to achieve an optimal capital structure while making financing decisions. An optimal capital structure is one in which the market value of shares is maximised.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:3px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u2022 Investment Decisions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a Financial Manager, you will play a critical role in deciding the most suitable investment options based on the available finance, considering both long-term and short-term considerations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long-term investment decisions, also known as Capital Budgeting, involve selecting the most appropriate investment proposal(s) by evaluating various factors to determine the one that aligns with the company&#8217;s goals and plans.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, short-term investment decisions involve selecting the best use of funds in the short run, such as managing current assets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:3px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u2022 Dividend Decisions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial Management also encompasses the decision-making process related to dividend distribution. As a Financial Manager, you will have to evaluate various factors and determine the best course of action, such as distributing profits among shareholders, retaining them for future use, or distributing a specific portion and returning the rest to the company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:3px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u2022 Liquidity Decisions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Effective management of current assets is essential to maintain the profitability and liquidity of a firm.
