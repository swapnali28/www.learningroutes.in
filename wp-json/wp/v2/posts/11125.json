On one hand, we believe that all the cosmic energies have been created by a woman, on the other, we consider daughters to be a burden and commit female foeticide. On one hand, a woman is worshipped by people all over the nation, on the other, they are confined to the four walls of the kitchen. On one hand, we call them Annapurnas, while on the other they are suffering from malnutrition and domestic violence. On one hand, the government is in a constant endeavour to empower women by initiating campaigns such as \u201cBeti Bachao, Beti Padhao\u201d; on the other, #MeToo has become a sad reality in working places.&nbsp; But the positive change in the contemporary world is that people now embrace girl child, and celebrate women\u2019s day in India owing to women\u2019s role in society &amp; in various movements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On this auspicious occasion of <em>Antarrashtriya Mahila Diwas<\/em> (International Women\u2019s Day), let&#8217;s raise a toast to all the powerful, courageous, intelligent, and beautiful women of India who have best played their parts as mothers, sisters, guides, mentors, and a friend to their families as well as to this world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let\u2019s take a trip down memory lane and discover how the women of India have always played an essential part in the growth and development of the nation. These women motivate us to celebrate women\u2019s day in India and recognise their achievements and contribution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:6px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Female Legends of Indian History<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.learningroutes.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/women-day-in-india2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11126\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Women and their sacrifices are undoubtedly a significant part of the ancient and mediaeval period in Indian history. They have always proved themselves equal to or even greater than men in every field. From fiercely fighting against British rule to setting high standards in the education sector, from handling household chores to managing the whole nation,&nbsp; women of every era have always marked their remarkable presence in almost every sector.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some extremely powerful and influential Indian women who made the nation proud with their immense physical and mental strength-<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Rani Lakshmi Bai<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cKhoob Ladi Mardani Vo Toh Jhansi Wali Rani Thi\u201d is a tribute to the bravest woman fighter in India. She fought tooth and nail against the British Army carrying a newborn child at her back with the horse&#8217;s reins in her mouth. Lakshmi Bai never agreed to surrender and kept fighting till death because it was not a piece of land but her respect and dignity which was at stake. Everyone was amazed and inspired by the valour she showed in the fight, and how bravely she embraced her victory even after being defeated.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:4px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Razia Begum<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An epitome of courage and bravery, Razia Begum was the first and the last woman Sultan of Delhi. Carrying her father\u2019s legacy forward,\u00a0 she kept on fighting for her identity, against all odds prevailing in the society that was continuously conspiring against her. She ferociously fought along with her army and was defeated by her own brother Muizuddin Bahram Shah and was imprisoned at Qila Mubarak in Bathinda.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:4px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Anandi Bai Joshi<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anandi Bai Gopal Rao Joshi was the first female Indian Physician. She was forcefully married at the age of 9 and conceived her first child at the age of 14. Due to a lack of proper medical care, the child passed away within 10 days, and that was the defining moment in her life. She decided to practise medical sciences backed up by the full support of her husband. She completed her medical course at the Women&#8217;s Medical College of Pennsylvania and even inspired many women in India to study medical education. She died at the early age of 22 due to Tuberculosis, even before she could practise medicine in her country.\u00a0 But she left a legacy of strength and courage behind her which enlightened many of the women around her.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:4px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Savitri Bai Phule<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with being the first female teacher in India, Savitri Bai Phule was a social reformer who was keen to help women break free from the shackles of caste discrimination, inequality, and the lack of education. Along with the support of her husband, she broke many social barriers, one of which included opening the first school for girls when it was unacceptable for women to gain an education. Besides her social work, Savitri Bai even encouraged people through her literary works to fight for their rights.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:6px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Indian Women Revolutionising Today\u2019s World<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.learningroutes.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/women-day-in-india1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11127\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many women who helped in the growth of the nation when we got liberated from British rule.
