<p>For freshers aspiring to become entrepreneurs, pursuing an MBA can be a valuable tool in charting their path towards success. While embarking on the journey of entrepreneurship can be thrilling, it can also be a daunting prospect. In such circumstances, the advantages of an MBA programme can be instrumental in simplifying the process of becoming an entrepreneur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By equipping individuals with skills like business planning, marketing, strategy, and finance, an MBA provides them with the knowledge and tools they need to make critical decisions and run a successful venture.</p>



<p>While an MBA is not a mandatory requirement for success as an entrepreneur, it can offer several benefits. It helps individuals gain a deeper understanding of market trends, customer needs, and the overall business environment, allowing them to make more informed decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, an <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/nmims-distance-mba-admission-2022/">MBA</a> can provide individuals with a competitive edge over their peers, offering them the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in a highly competitive business landscape.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">6 Ways an MBA Can Make You a Better Entrepreneur</h1>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VeAsNvu18Qn1Sq7RKzbbM1UxTDhUGBT9z-wlyHJqV9eFw0qu-sZeVb-nNdmm1xlNc90Th9KMNKiS_OetvXEA4AC0EQqwOzN2O8y65lSryhwWKNBruTfo97A_OcE2e7y6zYPEsng2qXB-AsEXdZ03f14" alt="" width="595" height="293"/></figure>



<p>Running a business is a challenging journey that involves uncertainty, ambiguity, and risk. Navigating the business world can be difficult if you don’t have a solid plan in mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, pursuing an MBA degree can provide you with a safe and reliable path to becoming a successful entrepreneur. In addition, an MBA programme can also provide you with the relevant knowledge and skills to manage a business effectively.</p>



<p>If you are confused, here are several ways in which an MBA degree can help individuals become better entrepreneurs:</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Learning Diverse Business Skills</strong></h3>



<p>As an entrepreneur, you will often find yourself juggling between various roles, such as CEO, Accountant, Marketer, and more. This is especially true for small business owners with limited resources to hire additional staff. For such individuals, pursuing an MBA can be a valuable way to develop a broad range of business skills to help them succeed in any role.</p>



<p>As an MBA programme covers various subjects, from accounting and finance to marketing and operations. Through the programme, you will learn various important skills including business strategy, organisational behaviour, and economics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, you will also get a chance to develop <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/7-skills-that-employers-want-to-see-in-fresh-graduates/">essential skills</a> like negotiation, public speaking, and teamwork. If you have a particular interest or passion, such as global management, you can specialise in that by pursuing an on-campus or online MBA programme in that field.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Fostering Global Perspective</strong></h3>



<p>With the rising popularity of business schools globally, pursuing an MBA degree offers an excellent opportunity to meet and interact with people from diverse cultural backgrounds. This can broaden one&#8217;s perspectives and foster a global mindset, essential in today&#8217;s interconnected world.</p>



<p>In addition, a global mindset also offers personal growth and financial benefits to organisations. According to a study, companies with an international outlook tend to perform better financially. In addition, they are better equipped to navigate cultural differences and build relationships with stakeholders worldwide.</p>



<p>As per World Economic Forum, by the year 2025, most of the global workforce will comprise millennials and Generation Z. As these generations value diversity and inclusion; therefore, businesses that prioritise these values can attract and retain top talent.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Learning Your Way</strong></h3>



<p>If you are an entrepreneur who values independence and innovation, pursuing an MBA could be a perfect choice. MBA programmes are designed to be flexible and accessible for busy working professionals, with online options available at affordable prices.</p>



<p>One of the key benefits of an MBA programme is the freedom and autonomy it provides. With a wide range of elective courses and opportunities to tailor your education to your unique interests and goals, you can focus on the areas of business that interest you the most.</p>



<p>Lastly, by enrolling in an MBA programme, you can combine your independent spirit with the knowledge and skills you need to succeed in business. So if you&#8217;re looking for a way to take your entrepreneurial ambitions to the next level, an MBA could be just what you need.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Expanding Your Network</strong></h3>



<p>Entrepreneurs know the importance of networking. In fact, their success often hinges on the strength of their connections. A robust network can provide fresh ideas, perspectives, and insights into new products, technologies, and business growth strategies.</p>



<p>An MBA programme offers access to like-minded and ambitious individuals who share your passion for business. Your classmates and professors can be valuable resources and sounding boards for ideas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, MBA programmes also organise networking events and career fairs, which enable students to connect with business leaders and potential employers. These events not only allow you to expand your network but also stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and practices.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Obtaining Leadership Skills</strong></h3>



<p>Becoming a successful entrepreneur is not just about having great ideas; it also involves leading a team towards success. Unfortunately, not everyone is a born leader, and 77% of businesses report a lack of leadership in their organisation. This is where pursuing an MBA programme can be beneficial for business owners, as it emphasises interpersonal skills development, which is essential for effective leadership.</p>



<p>MBA programmes offer courses in management, communication, and organisational behaviour that can give students a deeper understanding of what makes a great leader. Additionally, MBA students can put their leadership skills into practice through various projects and internships. For example, they may lead a team to complete a consulting project for a client or take up a leadership role in a student-run club or organisation. These experiences allow them to apply their learning in real-world situations and gain valuable feedback and insights.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Learning Risk Management</strong></h3>



<p>An MBA programme can be a game-changer for entrepreneurs when it comes to managing risks and making informed decisions. In the unpredictable business world, risks are inevitable, but an MBA programme can equip you with the skills to assess and manage them effectively.</p>



<p>While some entrepreneurs may rely on intuition, an MBA programme emphasises the importance of informed decision-making based on market analysis and data-driven insights. You will learn to identify the right factors, make calculated investments, and make strategic moves to propel your business forward.</p>



<p>In short, pursuing an MBA can give you the superpowers you need to navigate the challenges of the business world with confidence and make decisions that will help you stay ahead of the competition.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Top MBA Programmes for Entrepreneurs</h2>



<p>If you are planning on running your own business but are not sure about which MBA programme to opt for; the following list will help you clear your doubts.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Post Graduate Programme in Management (PGP)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>MBA in Entrepreneurship &amp; Family Business&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>MBA (Entrepreneurship)&nbsp;</td><td>MBA (Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>MBA in Sales Leadership</td><td>MBA in Product Management</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Entrepreneurs wondering whether pursuing an MBA is worth it should know that the answer is a resounding &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The benefits that an MBA can provide, such as networking opportunities, exposure to diverse perspectives, leadership training, and access to experienced mentors, are invaluable for entrepreneurs as they pitch their ideas, plan new ventures, and develop strategies for funding and growth. In some cases, entrepreneurs may forge new paths and create business models for which no established benchmarks exist. As an entrepreneur with an MBA, you will be better equipped to navigate the challenges of breaking new ground and to overcome the naysayers who claim, &#8220;It has never been done that way before.&#8221;</p>

<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>When you look at this meme, what do you see?</p>



<p>You see what a butterfly looks like before and after its metamorphosis, right?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ciBxNyTIu83-3GL-uvyeC944iPt17lq0nVTuYZDzv9Oq1_paCGWRFHETorYjZi0va1R8-ByKm3g89Y-vk05q1Vx-sD_6_nlBIkIvmsk9xlP_MeBV2tQkIpHdjbpMLFgThbzdGg0SJEoYy2BeA_aomB8" alt=""/></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Now, take a look at another version of this meme that has suddenly started flooding the internet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/EHgtHSrRZtSPBBXM4Thj5fLj2I9yhvJKPL1r3B9sGXhvke_A59vPjp5pnen93MlGMUah4M-Rg5DZQuk4mMeo91_2d1o-pHyYzb2R6jsS-EA8wqeTl4PT_AAKWadPmjMD3xcOUkhqBWllaa00fHivXZg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>This is what the Twitter logo looked like before, and how it is now!</p>



<p>Curious, right?</p>



<p>Twitter, as we know it, is not the same as it used to be. After the platform was taken over by Elon Musk, there have been many changes introduced to it. There have been lots of controversies around Twitter that have made significant headlines in the papers. Elon, the man behind the Twitter transformation, is wrapped around controversies. Recently, he has added yet another squabble to this list by replacing the Twitter website logo out of the blue. Yes, you heard it correctly, Mush has replaced the blue bird with a dog. And not just any dog, but the dog from the infamous ‘Doge Meme’.</p>



<p>Currently, #TwitterLogo is trending with more than 10K tweets.</p>



<p>But why did Musk do it? When did he do it? Is it some kind of a new prank or an April Fool’s joke?</p>



<p>Are you curious?</p>



<p>So are we!</p>



<p>Let’s explore possible reasons behind this change and its impact on the crypto world.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Happened?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/By_6m2x_bN67y0T4FIQivt3146tdHzjvR_AB7o9hfhJlNotzCgUYHUWmeeHSf1yRuUjFF4wWSVCbBQH8RO380XcipQd-eKoia8RmWRKcgMfwTX8E_49Fd4VfjXcvGvlnGXBLNgHk3NDDZQBz_7QL2uc" alt=""/></figure>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>On April 4th, at 12:20 AM, Elon Musk, Twitter’s current boss, posted this meme on his Twitter handle. Soon Twitter’s logo changed to the image of a dog. But this only happened on the Twitter web platform, not on the mobile application. Furthermore, not just any dog, but the famous dog meme “Doge”. Moreover, you must have heard about dogecoin, a cryptocurrency and a strong rival for Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>



<p>Everyone started to assume it was just a late April Fool&#8217;s prank or he was yet again trying to bring about a surge in the price of DogeCoin.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s Elon’s Reason?</strong></h2>



<p>Elon Musk, the billionaire, philanthropist and Tesla owner, is unpredictable. He does whatever he wants, whenever he feels like.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One fine morning, when you wake up and see a dog instead of a bird on Twitter, you start thinking what might be the possible explanation?</p>



<p>Elon posted a follow-up tweet where he mentioned about keeping an old promise.</p>



<p>Have a look at it:&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zH077b2Uzncx1nwaVieFhagIyEA_-cDZ_ATvjzpry6dkntY9HotC4wbVD1VqlRiRgplDIeWpVPwsO1iLZS56nYm-f2f_IlemfaVNdtutPpOVP5tr82t2cwyxH_nCmSQA9BEiVhhS-XbFqgMC34Dfs88" alt="" width="266" height="303"/></figure>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>A Twitter user “Chairman” suggested Elon to buy Twitter and change its bird logo to a doge.</p>



<p>He posted, “As promised,” with the screenshot of the old thread.</p>



<p>Now people are speculating that there might be another reason behind this change: to promote and boost the value of Dogecoin.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is a Dogecoin?</strong></h2>



<p>Dogecoin or Shiba Inu coin was created as a simple and light alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin is abundant, and more than 10,000 new coins are mined every minute.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Dogecoin has a substantial significance among memers. It is like a meme coin that is loved by its community. Dogecoin is not owned by anyone. However, notable personalities like Mark Cuban, Snoop Dog and Elon Musk have expressed their interest in Dogecoin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to this change, the price of Dogecoin has increased by almost 30% over the past few days.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Lawsuit Against Elon</strong></h2>



<p>In 2022, Dogecoin investors filed a lawsuit against musk, accusing him of driving its price to an all-time high only to let the price fall. Musk’s lawyer defended giving the argument that those tweets about dogecoin were innocuous and silly. Furthermore, it states that his words, such as “Dogecoin Rulz”, and “No highs, no lows, only Doge”, were too vague to claim fraud.</p>



<p>Multiple investors felt they had incurred massive losses by investing in dogecoin, and Elon was the reason behind it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, Musk asked a federal judge to drop the $258 billion lawsuit against him as his tweets were just for fun.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Doge Effect</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7IeMqoYg919QeESS7B0K8MPAZdyfLKi6RcIXpWEcRz9E9Pxoyezz_AiUn7LjmrrB8TswJTquqFWHwh6T8WR6CbbBUoHqIc1me2_f7c4vCC6uAs7bCD3FAtNYxSRQpauTLfJOa0EXJDgApJ1l0JAj9w" alt="" width="395" height="296"/></figure>



<p>The Shiba Inu effect or the Doge effect is a concern for many. When we see doge, we get the idea of the meme, and we tend to laugh. People are concerned about Twitter becoming a joke. After Elon’s takeover, Twitter has seen some rough days; from firing half of its workforce to a buggy feed, it has seen all. Users were upset about the slow performance, monetisation of the blue tick and much more. The sudden pop-up of doge instead of the bluebird is a bit of concern for many. Some speculate that the dog is just a late April fool prank that Musk forgot to pull.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is undebatable that Twitter, after the Musk takeover, is not the same. Elon keeps on altering it and introduces something new every day. Within this short time, he has made more than ten changes to the platform, including changing its logo to Doge. This shows his affection for Doge and how badly he wants to promote it. He wants Doge to overtake Bitcoin and make the coin rule the crypto world.</p>



<p>Now, popular brands are engaging in this doge effect and posting various memes related to these changes.</p>



<p>Here are a few memes made by RealMe:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9tfL_mIsvAknU11DbBx4_XVjlrrWIu0cqtPRJua3TBtN3GbsU4cj-VGiozSoCU3qBLfXS05iT_JEpigGMfk5nfpTXODM0XFMeiX6c2BM3Bq64502lZvZKhrcZBpX9b6ad6lzDzrH2NDTt7oMAcdFOtE" alt="" width="418" height="418"/></figure>

<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Takeaway</strong></h2>



<p>In conclusion, Elon Musk&#8217;s Twitter icon change to the Doge meme has caused quite a stir among Twitter users and Dogecoin investors. While some speculate that it is just a late April Fool&#8217;s prank, others believe that it is a strategic move by Musk to promote Dogecoin and boost its value. Regardless of his reasons, one thing is sure: Musk&#8217;s unpredictability and willingness to take risks have once again made headlines and sparked conversations. Only time will tell if the Doge effect will have a lasting impact on Twitter and the crypto world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Do you remember the days when you were a part of a Facebook confession page, where you would share your life experiences? It may be about your workplace, family, college, or anything. You used to pour your heart out on those pages.</p>



<p>Now imagine, you and your boss are on the same page, and you unknowingly confess some not-so-good thing about your boss. That guy reads your confession, and what happens to you the next day?</p>



<p>You are smart enough to guess!</p>



<p>What if I tell you there is a platform where you can write anything you want, whatever you feel, while maintaining your anonymity? Will you agree to post there? I don&#8217;t know about you, but I would use that platform to write out my feelings.</p>



<p>Meet the “Hood” app, India’s first pseudonymous platform, where you can write anything without revealing who you are.</p>



<p>Spooky, right? Let’s dive deeper into the topic and find out more about this intriguing platform.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Zorro: The Anonymous Hero</strong></h2>



<p>Have you seen the 1988’s American film, “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorro">The Mask of Zorro</a>”?</p>



<p>You may have heard about it but might not have seen it. Zorro was the name of the mysterious entity that fought against the Spanish during the Mexican War of Independence. He defended Mexican peasants and commoners from the corrupt governor. What’s most fascinating about this brave hero is that he did all this while maintaining his anonymity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You must be wondering how we reached onto war stories while talking about an anonymous social networking site. That’s because the Hood app was previously named Zorro inspired by the above tale.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Founders</strong></h2>



<p>Jasveer Singh, Abhishek Asthana and Deepak Kumar started Zorro Internet Private Limited with a vision to promote free speech in the cloak of anonymity. Even though the idea of being anonymous is not new for social networking sites, creating a platform that is completely anonymous is quite innovative. Abhishek Asthana realised the need for an anonymous social platform when he used to write anonymously on Twitter under the name Gabbar Singh. The other co-founder, Jasveer Singh has worked with multiple companies, whereas Deepak Kumar has an engineering background and is currently serving as the CTO for the platform.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The App</strong></h2>



<p>The Hood is similar to Twitter except for being pseudonymous. Similar to Zorro, the masked hero, the platform aims to provide people with a space where they are free to express themselves. Moreover, they will not have any fear of being harassed or publicly criticised on social media. According to the founders, everything is on social media, and we are exposed to it. We are judged, criticised, bullied, or trolled whenever we post anything or share our opinion. But with the Hood, you will not be bullied, harassed or trolled. The app&#8217;s most exciting feature is the anonymous groups. You can make college and company groups and express your opinion without anyone knowing your identity.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How It Works?</strong></h2>



<p>As the CEO of Hood claimed, anonymity is a curse; it gives people the licence to bad behaviour. Due to this, multiple social media platforms had to shut down after bullying and fake news became harder to control. Hood counters these problems, as the platform is not entirely anonymous. Instead, you can connect with people in your contacts and interact using a pseudonymous name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The founders wanted to build a platform that is more like Twitter, where the frequency of the posts matters. Hence, in the hood, your feed is constantly getting updated. While signing up, you would be required to provide your mobile number and select a pseudonym. You may also connect your profile to Twitter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best part is that all the posts on the Hood are posted under your pseudonymous name, and no one can reach you directly. The content on the Hood is moderated through a “Sensitive Content” disclaimer.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Shark Tank</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="559" src="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hood-app-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11202" srcset="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hood-app-1.jpg 900w, https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hood-app-1-300x186.jpg 300w, https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hood-app-1-768x477.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></figure>



<p>Hood gained popularity when it was aired in the second season of Shark Tank. In the fortieth episode, the three founders asked for INR 1.2 Crores for 0.2% equity of the company valuing it at INR 600 crores. The founders claimed that the users&#8217; data are encrypted using 256-bit encryption techniques, At that time, the app had over 7.7 lakhs users. The app has around 2.4 lakh active users, and around 6,000 posts are posted daily. Moreover, about 1,800 new threads are created on the platform every day. Shark Aman Gupta and Peyush Bansal made a combined offer of INR 60 lacs for 0.54% equity of the company and INR 60 lacs debt at a 12% interest rate at a valuation of 112 crores.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, Hood raised $3.2 million in a seed funding round led by VC firms 3one4 Capital and 9Unicorn Ventures. The company also has backing from some notable investors such as Vijay Shekhar Sharma, CEO of Paytm; Kunal Shah, CEO of CRED; Ritesh Aggarwal, CEO of OYO and many more.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>



<p>The world has become smaller with the advancement of technology and social media. You think multiple times before posting content, as what you post impacts your relationship with your friends, families, neighbours and colleagues. Hood eliminates this issue by giving you the power of pseudonymity. Students, teachers, workers, entrepreneurs, basically everyone can write anything without worrying about its consequences. No one will be able to track, hurt, bully, or identify you. It could beat the monopoly of Twitter and even challenge Meta. Thus, if you are worried about what your boss might do if he reads your confession about the workplace, you don’t need to worry; just Hood it.</p>

<p>“Money moves from those who do not manage it to those who do.” </p>
<cite>Dave Ramsay</cite></blockquote>



<p>We all know what a bank is, right?</p>



<p>The safe financial institution where we deposit our hard-earned money. Nothing can harm our savings if we keep them in the bank. They are the protector of our money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what if all this is a myth?&nbsp;</p>



<p>No financial institution, no matter how big they are, guarantees to keep your deposits safe. It can only provide you with a platform where you can save your money and use it at your convenience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now before jumping to today’s topic of discussion, that is, the infamous SVB Bank collapse, you should know a bit about the history of US bank failures. But first, let’s understand why banks fail.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Does Bank Failure Occur?</h2>



<p>Bank failure refers to when a bank cannot meet the demand of the public, investors and depositors. It can occur when a bank is unable to pay the debt or does not have enough liquid assets such as cash or gold. This is generally due to the wrong investment decisions taken by the bank officials or due to the accumulation of huge bad loans. This creates panic among the public, and they rush to banks to liquidate their deposits. Thus, it leads to a <em>“bank run”.</em> </p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Bank Run?</h2>



<p>Bank run refers to the term when customers lose trust in the abilities of the bank to take care of their money and start to get worried about their deposits in the bank and thus, rush to the bank to withdraw their entire deposits at once. When all of the bank&#8217;s customers withdraw simultaneously at the same time, the bank runs out of liquid assets like cash and is unable to meet the demand of the customers. This causes the bank’s cash to run dry which, in turn, leads to its collapse.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The History of US Bank Failures</h2>



<p>The Great Depression is known as the worst economic collapse in the modern history of the US. It started in 1929 with the stock market&#8217;s fall and continued till the late 1930s. During this phase, unemployment reached 20%, and more than 5,000 banks went bankrupt. This caused fear and panic among people, and the money supply in the country collapsed. John Poole, the president of the Federal American National Bank, assured shareholders in 1933 that the banks in the US would not collapse but later in that year, 4,000 US banks collapsed.</p>



<p>Later in the year 2008, the US witnessed another depression with the collapse of Washington Mutual Bank. At that time, the bank had assets worth $307 billion and deposits of $188 billion. It was then sold by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to JPMorgan Chase for a mere $1.9 billion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="555" src="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/silicon-valley-bank-collapse.png" alt="silicon valley bank collapse" class="wp-image-11183" srcset="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/silicon-valley-bank-collapse.png 900w, https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/silicon-valley-bank-collapse-300x185.png 300w, https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/silicon-valley-bank-collapse-768x474.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></figure>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Collapse of Silicon Valley &amp; Signature Banks</h2>



<p>Silicon Valley Bank was started in 1983 to support the growth of the startup industry. SVB was the 16th-largest bank in the USA and had assets worth $209 billion.</p>



<p>But the question remains what went wrong with Silicon Valley Bank? The answer is simple.&nbsp; It didn’t have enough cash to pay its customers. This is majorly due to the wrong investment decisions taken by the bank officials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SVB had deposited most of its assets in government bonds which are considered to be the safest form of investment. These government-issued bonds had low-interest yields and would have generated good returns over the period of time. But to control the inflation rate of the US, the Federal Reserve hiked the interest rates of the bond; as a result, the price of the bond fell. Since the price of the bond and its annual yield are inversely proportional, the bank suffered a loss of $1.8 billion. To meet the withdrawal request of the depositors, the bank had to sell some of its bonds at a loss. Then it tried to raise funds through investment which also failed, creating panic among its investors. This led to the bank&#8217;s stock price falling by 60% in a single day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation took over the bank operations and its deposits to control panic and meet the customers&#8217; demand. SVB’s $175 billion deposits are now under the control of FDIC, and its assets are put up for auction.</p>



<p>When the news about the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank spread, Signature Bank’s customers had withdrawn billions of dollars worth of deposits. To control the deposit rate and prevent a bank run, FDIC closed the bank on March 12.&nbsp; It had assets worth $110 billion and over $89 billion in deposits. FDIC has created a bridge bank called Signature Bridge Bank, where customers can use the same banking facility and can retain their deposit in the account. This is the third-largest bank failure in US history.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="942" src="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/silicon-valley-bank-collapse-explained.jpg" alt="silicon valley bank collapse explained" class="wp-image-11184" srcset="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/silicon-valley-bank-collapse-explained.jpg 900w, https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/silicon-valley-bank-collapse-explained-287x300.jpg 287w, https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/silicon-valley-bank-collapse-explained-768x804.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></figure>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Can We Learn from the US Bank&#8217;s Failure?</h2>



<p>The US has a black history in financial markets. From the great depression to high inflation, its market has incurred huge losses. This has affected people, investors, venture capitalists and shareholders. The sudden collapse of the bank has taught us that even highly qualified &amp; experienced people can make bad investment decisions. We believe the bank keeps our money safe but generates a good return by investing. When that investing fails, whose money fails, ours, correct?</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What can Banks learn from US Bank&#8217;s failure? </h2>



<p>As stated by Srinath Sridharan, Author, Policy Researcher and Corporate Advisor, <em>“They (banking and financial institutions) should not be swayed by the greed of higher interest rates to put all their deposits in one single entity. The lesson for the Indian financial institution is simple — improve their risk management framework and have a real-time analysis of Asset Liability Management (ALM). With every interest rate swing, the ALM needs reinforcement.”</em></p>



<p>According to reports, the collapse can create short-term panic but it will not affect the economy as a whole because there are bigger players in the market. Although it will affect the startups because the bank was established with the motive to facilitate them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is imperative for the banks to diversify their assets that can help them to create liquidity in terms of card or gold immediately.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Monopoly and Wall Street</h2>



<p>The current bank crisis, draws for us a very realistic picture of how the economic sector is hegemonized by one or two big financial institutions. For instance, if we look at Wall Street, there is a monopoly of banks like SVB, Goldman Sach, and Fortress. Thus, it becomes critical for us as an economy to retrace our steps and counter this supremacy as the failure of one bank can shatter the stock market and thus, the entire economy of a country.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Impact on the Indian Economy </h2>



<p>Although the Indian startups do not depend on foreign investment, to quote Jyoti Prakash Gadia, the Managing Director of Resurgent India<em> “As SVB was primarily a major banker for the startups in the US, the startup ecosystem in India is also likely to be impacted adversely.”</em></p>



<p>Evidently, Indian corporations that have holdings or subsidiaries in the US and kept accounts with SVB will be affected. Although, the number is less but is not negligible. One such example is Nazara Tech which has INR 60 crore trapped in one of the SVB companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is worth noting that the Indian Startup Economy will face issues but only for a short period of time.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Takeaway</strong></h2>



<p>Has the economy been severely affected? Are people taking sides? Well, of course, people always do. Rishi Sunak, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, declared that he will always support businesspeople, inventors, and young people who are creating the future. He also said that<em> “What really matters for economic success – is innovation. If we want our country to succeed, we need to do what we’ve always done and embrace new technologies and the people and culture that create them.”</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="461" src="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/economic-success-quote.jpg" alt="economic success quote" class="wp-image-11185" srcset="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/economic-success-quote.jpg 900w, https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/economic-success-quote-300x154.jpg 300w, https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/economic-success-quote-768x393.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></figure>



<p>All parties concerned are working towards solutions but it Is unclear whether the global economic worries will be resolved by SVB and Signature Banks or if another significant development will soon emerge. Others, like the startup ecosystem, will also need to be agile in order to move forward in the correct way.</p>

<p>Were you an “Art Attack” fan? Or somebody who enjoyed “Dora the Explorer”? If yes, then you are in for a treat. Both these examples fit the new and evolving concept of “Edutainment”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But are you wondering what Edutainment is? As per a recent definition, edutainment is a type of entertainment that is intended to both teach and amuse. According to studies, Poor Richard’s Almanack by Benjamin Franklin is considered the earliest account of the field. He created a manual for the laymen that included both fun and instructive materials, such as puzzles and moral guidelines. Later, it is said that Walt Disney used the term edutainment to describe his &#8220;True-Life Adventures&#8221; television series.</p>



<p>So, the concept of entertainment infused in education is not new.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are you Inspired by Sheldon Cooper to Win a Nobel Prize?&nbsp;</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m Not Crazy. My Mother Had Me Tested.&#8221;</em></p>
<cite><em>Sheldon Cooper, Big Bang Theory</em></cite></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="506" src="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/big-bang-theory.jpg" alt="big bang theory" class="wp-image-11168" srcset="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/big-bang-theory.jpg 900w, https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/big-bang-theory-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/big-bang-theory-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></figure>



<p>Who doesn’t know this super famous dialogue? If you don’t, let’s throw some light on the matter at hand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The dialogue is from an American sitcom, The Big Bang Theory. The show is centred around four friends who are at the top of their careers in Science. Over the period of time, the audience learns that, Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Leonard Hofstadter opted for science because in their childhood, they were inspired by Professor Proton, the children&#8217;s science show host. He used to demonstrate scientific principles using everyday objects. Which is the perfect example of edutainment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another character that was introduced on the TV Show was Bill Nye or popularly known as Bill Nye- The Science Guy. He too, used the tricks of daily life to explain the most complex scientific theories. Additionally, he had his own shows and movies such as “Bill Nye, The Science Guy”; “Bill Nye Saves the World” and others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Evidently, it testifies that when education is clubbed with entertainment, it helps students understand better, they learn the practical aspect of the most difficult concepts and they are also inspired to choose that field as in the case of Sheldon Cooper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the period of time, many video games, toys, innovative websites, and youtube channels have been introduced based on this concept. But, before we look at some of these examples, you should know how much contribution it has made and what’s next in the store. According to market researcher Ambient Insight, revenues from educational-games increased from 2.6 billion USD in 2016 to 7.3 billion USD in 2021.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Learn with John Green and Code with Barbie&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>The list does not end here, some of the other examples are: Boulevard, It’s OK to Be Smart, LEGO and others. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="458" src="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/education-entertainment-countinuum.jpg" alt="education entertainment continuum" class="wp-image-11174" srcset="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/education-entertainment-countinuum.jpg 900w, https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/education-entertainment-countinuum-300x153.jpg 300w, https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/education-entertainment-countinuum-768x391.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></figure>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Edutainment: Black or White? Or Grey?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>With every new concept, there come doubts and the question if you can rely on it. Similarly, edutainment has both sides. On one hand students are making the most out of this breakthrough innovation. On the other, there are rising concerns about them growing accustomed to fancy entertainment items to the point where we run the risk of them being dependent on such models for learning. This is largely the reason why some people are sceptical of employing edutainment technologies and material in education.</p>



<p>Let’s look at some other cons of this method:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>As much as the country has progressed, there are still some areas where students don’t have access to technology, mobile phones, or even good wifi connection.&nbsp;</li>



<li>No doubt, smartphones are a distraction. Hence, it might interrupt the learning process.</li>



<li>A greater emphasis on technology and gamification can lead to a complete lack of human interaction between teacher-students as well as peers.</li>



<li>Schools and other learning institutions are yet to adapt and accept this new system.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>On the flip side, “media literacy” is what India is focusing on. Hence, we can not neglect the advantages, which are:</p>



<ol>
<li>With edutainment, it is believed that students will be more engaged.</li>



<li>Digital platforms are a hub of information, students can pick anything that they wish to study.</li>



<li>These platforms are not age-restricted.&nbsp;</li>



<li>It also helps students to explore more and enhance their imagination.</li>
</ol>



<p>Using digital resources in the classroom “helps students master tools they’ll need both personally and professionally to thrive in a tech-based world” as claimed by a research conducted by Tech Edvocate.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Following the Footsteps of South Tapiola High School, Finland</strong></h2>



<p>Though, the question remains the same, “Is society ready to adopt edutainment or do we still have some scruples?” Indubitably, the system is still new, can reach heights, and even do wonders in the education industry. But the way in which education is imparted must change if we are to teach the abilities required to succeed in the 21st century and produce the leaders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a study by Microsoft, the human attention span is just 8 seconds which calls for innovative techniques in the education sectors to hook students. The best example of this is South Tapiola High School, Finland which has an industry-oriented curriculum that caters to the subjects that have been flourishing in the 21st century such as entrepreneurship, active citizenship, and many more. Additionally, the school has collaborated with Microsoft and Dell to incorporate technology into their academics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We live in a world that is fast-paced. Hence, edutainment is not far away.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Do You Think about Edutainment?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
