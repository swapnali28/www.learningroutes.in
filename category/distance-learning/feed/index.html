										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Distance learning is a form of learning in which students and teachers are not present in the same place or time but use different means of communication to facilitate the teaching-learning process. Distance education began through the <strong>use of postcards by Isaac Pitman in 1840. However, today the sector has evolved a lot and employs a variety of media such as video chat, computer internet, print, film, television, and other modes of communication. </strong>By now, it must be clear that distance education is designed to focus on pedagogy and andragogy in education to students without any physical presence. Let us explore more about it. Here are some amazing distance learning facts that most people don&#8217;t know about.</p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>1. The <strong>University of London</strong> was the first to launch a distance learning course in the year 1858. This is said to be the formal initiation of distance learning. </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>2. Distance learning in the true sense was first started by <strong>Sir Isaac Pitman in the 1840s</strong> wherein he used to send postcards to students. He taught a system of stenography by mailing stenographically transcribed texts on postcards and receiving transcripts from students in exchange for proofreading. </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>3. The first correspondence school in the <strong>United States</strong> was<strong> founded in 1873</strong>. It was named the “Society to Encourage Studies at Home.” The institute was directed towards promoting education among women. It encouraged women to devote some part of every day to study. </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>4. Studies at home was founded and encouraged by <strong>Anna Eliot Ticknor</strong> with the aim to empower women of America who are already busy with their household chores and cannot devote their time and are not able to attend classes in regular mode. </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>5. <strong>Wolsey Hall, Oxford</strong> is the first distance learning college in the UK which was founded in  1894. </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>6. Wolsey Hall, Oxford is the <strong>largest homeschooling college</strong> in the world which offers various courses in Primary, Secondary, IGCSE, and many other A-level subjects. It offers distance education to more than <strong>120 different countries</strong>.</p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>7. Distance learning is a <a href="https://www.indiacollegeshub.com/distance-education-in-india.aspx">relatively new concept in India</a>. It has been around in the UK since 1858. However, in India, it only dates back to the early 1960s.</p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>8. In the year <strong>1961, in India, the Central Advisory Board for Education</strong> established a committee <strong>chaired by Dr. D. S. Kothari</strong> to make important suggestions regarding the nature, scope, and structure of distance learning courses.</p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>9. In India, the first <strong>Distance Education Center</strong> was established in 1962 by the <strong>University of Delhi. </strong>It was later renamed as the School of Correspondence Course and Continuing Education. </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>10. <a href="https://deb.ugc.ac.in/DEB/LearningTrends"><strong>The University Grants Commission took over</strong> the Distance Education Council</a> in <strong>2013 </strong>and established the Distance Education Authority to oversee future distance education in India. </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>11. According to <strong>AISHE reports</strong> (2017-18), <strong>distance enrollment accounts for 11% </strong>of total higher education enrollment. Most students and working professionals opt for distance education.  </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>12. By <strong>2027</strong>, <strong>e-learning is expected to reach well over $1 trillion</strong>. It is a 21% increase from the $250 billion surpassed in 2020. </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>13. <strong>E-learning</strong> is more engaging than traditional instructor-led training sessions and <a href="https://elearningindustry.com/elearning-is-essential-not-overrated-5-key-reasons"><strong>can improve knowledge retention by up to 60%</strong>.</a> With the comfort of home, students can stay focused without getting distracted. </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>14. If we look at employee skill development programmes, it has been found that e-learning takes 40-60% less time per employee as compared to traditional instructor-led training. </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>15. 40% of companies say that e-learning has helped them attain a higher revenue, and companies that offer e-learning have seen a 25% or more increase in revenue per employee. This is because e-learning is more affordable than other means of learning and there is no need to set up heavy infrastructural facilities which helps companies to cut extra expenses. </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>16. The enterprise e-learning market is expected to <strong>grow to USD 38.09 billion between 2020 and 2024.</strong></p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>17. 25% of Indian students are enrolled in at least one distance learning course.</p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>18. <strong>In the year 2020, the mobile e-learning industry grew by $38 billion.</strong> This upward trend is expected to continue and reach to <strong>$6 billion by 2022.</strong> To streamline the process of distance learning, more and more universities and institutes are moving toward mobile apps so as to offer students more accessibility. </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>19. Developed by <strong>MIT and Harvard, EdX</strong> is an example of a massive open-source online course. The platform has over 20 million users and over 70 million signups.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>Bonus Point:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>The sector of open and distance learning is booming. Especially after the covid-19 pandemic, the sector has seen tremendous growth. Today, it is seen as an affordable option for working professionals and students who can not attend classes physically. The ODL mode comes with the flexibility wherein the students become more skillful with the help of online learning methods without having to leave their homes. Many companies now opt for e-learning to upskill their employees. Here, we have discussed facts about students, distance learning facts, online learning platforms and much more to evaluate the growth of the industry. It will be interesting to see what new transformations are awaiting the ODL industry as technology continues to advance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>India has the largest population of young individuals under the demographic age of 5 to 24, which makes the future of the Indian education industry bright and colorful. According to IBEF, the education sector in India was&nbsp; valued atUS $117 billion in the year 2020 and is forecasted to reach approximately US $225 billion in 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The Indian Edtech market size is expected to reach US$ 30 billion by 2031. </strong>The credit for the same goes not only to traditional mode of studies but also to skill-based open &amp; distance learning courses. <strong>According to KPMG, India has the second largest e-education sector after the US.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The Indian Government has taken various initiatives to empower and inculcate practicality. Focused upon skill-based learning, the government has been taking several initiatives to increase the enrollment rate by 30% in 2020 by means of campaigns like “Skill India” and “Digital India.”&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why is Skill-Based ODL Education Important?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>According to the recent UGC regulation, ODL courses are now at par with other modes of education because they provide students with the best of both worlds. Most universities offer distance courses night classes or weekend classes. This mode can also be called a hybrid mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ODL courses are specially designed while keeping working professionals in mind so that they can continue their job or business while upskilling on the side. In this mode, the students can interact with the teachers for doubts or exam queries and also with their fellow mates in an offline setting. However, they can also avail the option of self-paced learning.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/y3i6mMRzojvxgNr4Gq4ze0d8r-npVQvRUXUHYTKSYPXlAHargqBto1_ka7onYMruTdbLkmu6e5mlo1igVsNhI3DmB6rX0rVr_t0OgmEXfu4SJkJtr0PSoID6f4PAJl8_npICpAatxSTz8Wf2cGgK19oHDNYeb8X55ekx9kHXeuZb_eZ0O4Jv76L0j2qy" alt=""/></figure>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pre-Requisites for Choosing an ODL course</strong></h3>



<p>The trick to leveraging ODL courses is to keep a few critical pre-requisites in mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first and foremost thing to keep in mind is choosing an institute. This decision can make or break your career. The integral component while considering your institute should be</p>



<ol><li>Course Specializations</li><li>Tuition Fee</li><li>Accreditations</li><li>Networking Opportunities&nbsp;</li><li>Placement Assistance&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Another thing you should consider while opting for a distance course is the institute&#8217;s location. It is impractical to opt for a course from a university that is far away from your location because that will affect the time, lifestyle, and transportation cost you wanted to avoid with a full-time course.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Should You Choose an ODL Course?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Since we have discovered the scope of part-time courses and established the pre-requisites that should be taken care of, it is time to validate the fact and understand why you should opt for this mode of education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the most significant advantages of ODL mode of learning is the ability to balance your studies with your work or family obligations. Distance education allows you the freedom to combine the two aspects of your life, as well as the financial benefits of being able to continue working while still funding your studies.</p>



<p>Some added benefits are &#8211;&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. If you are already in a job, then ODL courses can help you get a promotion&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. It can help you expand your job options</p>



<p>3. You can make a transition to your job in a field that you want to work in</p>



<p>4. You can cut down the transportation cost, living expenses, and miscellaneous costs&nbsp;</p>



<p>5. While pursuing a degree, you can obtain professional credentials while working</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Which Universities in India offer ODL Courses?</strong></h3>



<p>Distance education is in vogue lately and many, many universities are trying to incorporate this mode of education. While the process is still going on, some universities have successfully done it and are setting an example.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To list a few of them: &#8211;&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>NMIMS NGASCE</li><li>Symbiosis Centre For Distance Learning Institute</li><li>Sikkim Manipal University</li><li>Amity University</li><li>Jawaharlal Nehru University</li><li>Chandigarh University</li></ol>



<p>And the list goes on.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Name of University Offering&nbsp; Distance Education&nbsp;</strong></td><td><strong>Course</strong></td><td><strong>Fee Structure (Per Year)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>NMIMS&nbsp;</td><td>MBA</td><td>1,68,000</td></tr><tr><td>SCDL</td><td>BCA</td><td>54,000&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>UPES</td><td>MBA</td><td>1,50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Chandigarh University</td><td>BCom</td><td>12,850</td></tr><tr><td>Jaipur National University</td><td>BBA</td><td>14,000</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Job Opportunities for Students Who Choose ODL Courses?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Is an ODL Degree of any use? Do students get the same packages as those who are full-time students? Are there any globally recognised universities in India that offer distance courses?&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are some of the questions that immediately popped up when we talked about the distance mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, the answer is, “Yes, you can find all the opportunities.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though the idea of ODL courses is not that popular, the job opportunities are not limited. A student who has opted for such a course will get the equal and same type of opportunities as a full-time student.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recruiters now understand that skills and experience are more important than the mode of education.<strong> </strong>Since there is no effect on opportunities, there is also no effect on the packages, and there is an extra advantage that your working hours will be less.&nbsp;<br>The only difference in case of opting for an ODL course is that the eligibility may vary. Apart from a specific education qualification, the universities may ask for some work experience.<br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has transformed the world in more than one way. We all have borne the brunt of it. The pandemic has particularly transmuted the education system in India. Online &amp; Distance Learning (ODL) came to the rescue at a time when life had come to a halt. Since then it has considerably replaced the regular mode of learning and continues to do so even today. To encourage more enrollments in the ODL mode of learning, the <a href="https://www.ugc.ac.in/pdfnews/8526483_ODL-Online-degree-through-conventional-mode.pdf">UGC recently released a notification</a> wherein it has placed Online Learning, Open and Distance Learning (ODL), and Regular Learning on the same pedestal.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The New UGC Regulation</strong></h3>



<p>The said notification in question was released by the UGC on September 2, 2022. It says that all the undergraduate, postgraduate, and postgraduate diploma programs which are being offered Online Learning and Open and Distance Learning (ODL), will now enjoy the same status as the courses being run in the regular mode. This move was made to accelerate the development of Online Learning and Open and Distance Learning (ODL) in the realm of Indian education.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OKia9xOESMAiBK8GBH2HFRJOXHawtcp6sDO_m6TQsoWWBa7d5DnJZNcdEaQXc1HkMgtpt19rezGNg7-keq9mMpI6AkkiAlgPe_rcW-VwugHHUmZJ7o6Qh8VxRZpsWzJnqvsjXBZygcl2dKGYrT35i1y67tjVKNCRzNXPPj5QxypBfYYi0uAtPczWgA" alt=""/></figure>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Regular Learning vs. Open and Distance Learning (ODL) vs. Online Learning</strong></h3>



<p>To develop a better understanding about the three modes of education that are being offered in the country, let us first look at their features individually. If we talk about the regular mode of learning, the teaching-learning process takes place in a conventional classroom set-up. However, the same is not the case when it comes to Online Learning as well as Open and Distance learning (ODL). In case of ODL mode, the teachers and the students meet only occasionally at the respective learning centres. This absence of a regular teacher-student interaction is compensated by providing self-learning material to students which is often sent through mail or post. Therefore, the students are solely responsible for their learning. Examinations for Open and Distance Learning (ODL) courses are conducted at the various regional centres set-up by the university.</p>



<p>Moving on to Online learning, it has revolutionised the entire educational domain. It is very different from both regular mode of learning as well as Open and Distance Learning (ODL). Here, teachers and students interact using a technologically advanced infrastructure. The lessons are delivered online using various Learning Management Software. Lectures are delivered either Live or in the form of recorded classes. The information is supplemented by online accessible resources. Examination for online learning is conducted from anywhere through internet-enabled equipment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The table given below presents the comparison between Regular Learning, Online Learning, and Open and Distance Learning (ODL):</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Criteria</strong></td><td><strong>Regular Learning</strong></td><td><strong>Online Learning</strong></td><td><strong>Open and Distance Learning (ODL)</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Student-Teacher Interaction</strong></td><td>In-person interaction</td><td>Frequent interaction via virtual platforms</td><td>Rare Student-Teacher Interaction</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Class Schedule</strong></td><td>Fixed Class Timings</td><td>Flexible Class Timings</td><td>Rarely Scheduled</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Examination Schedule and Assignment Submissions</strong></td><td>Rigid Schedule</td><td>Flexible Schedule</td><td>Rigid Schedule</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pedagogy</strong></td><td>Interactive, Blended (Traditional+Modern) Pedagogy</td><td>Interactive, Blended (Traditional+Modern) Pedagogy</td><td>Less interactive</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Networking</strong></td><td>Wide, Professional Networking</td><td>Wide, Professional Networking</td><td>Low Opportunity of Networking</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Attributes of the UGC Notification</strong></h3>



<p>The current UGC decision to equate the modes of Online Learning and Open and Distance Learning (ODL) with the regular learning mode will boost admission in the former modes of education. It will particularly benefit the working professionals, who want to upskill but are loaded with a heavy schedule. The flexibility inherent in the Online learning mode and the Open Distance Learning (ODL) mode facilitates them to efficiently manage both.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As all the mediums are now put at an equal footing, the UGC enables a student to switch to another mode, if and only if the courses and the higher educational institutions follow the set guidelines. This provides freedom to the students and the working professionals to structure their career paths.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a student has already taken admission to a course through the said mediums in the higher educational institutions, that were recognised during the time of admission, but their recognition was later repealed, the current UGC notification will apply to such admission if the UGC norms are properly complied with&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Things to Consider about UGC Rules and Regulations 2022</strong></h3>



<p>The UGC circulated a cautionary notice three weeks back regarding the <a href="https://www.ugc.ac.in/pdfnews/3409840_Public-Notice-DEB.pdf">UGC Rules and Regulations 2022</a>. The notice educates the students, who wish to enrol themselves in Online learning and Open and Distance Learning (ODL) courses.</p>



<p>As mentioned earlier, the UGC has recognised only those higher education institutions for the medium of Online learning and Open and Distance Learning&nbsp; (ODL), that meet its conditions. In its previous notice, the UGC asked students to look out for such information, when choosing a higher educational institution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, to impart holistic education, inclusive of the non-theoretical curriculum (if any), the UGC forbids some courses to be imparted through the Online Learning mode and Open and Distance Learning&nbsp; (ODL) mode. These courses, like Engineering, Physiotherapy, Medical, Architecture, Hotel Management, etc, have indispensable practical courses, to which the Online Learning and Open and Distance Learning (ODL) mediums can’t do justice. Also, M. Phil. and Ph. D. Programmes are forbidden for said modes. Therefore, the students, who wish to take admissions in these courses, can’t do so through the said modes of learning.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s colleges have better methods of teaching their students, thanks to the rise of technology. Traditionally, Computer laboratories were available in the majority of classrooms, enabling students to gain required digital literacy skills in preparation for further education and their future employment.</p>



<p>One advantage of technology that the young generation today has is the option of <strong>distance learning</strong>. The idea has no doubt brought fresh ways with which technology can be utilized for teaching the students and the concept has been successful so far, no matter for what level or grades it is used.</p>



<p>Popular and known educational Institutes like NMIMS were already providing distance courses for years and the arrival of the pandemic added fuel to the concept as students got highly comfortable and familiar with the process of taking from home. Now, more and more education seekers are choosing the option of studying from the comfort of their homes and are happily accepting<strong> distance learning courses.</strong></p>



<p>Here are a few advantages of why a student should enrol in distance programs</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Time-saving</strong>&#8211;</h4>



<p>You won&#8217;t need to commute to campus for a distance course or navigate crowded hallways to get to the lecture hall. Consequently, you will have more time for studying and other crucial facets of your life.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Flexible schedules</strong>&#8211;</h4>



<p>Some students have to work to support their families. They also make sure that they complete their education, though. Being able to juggle both is a little simpler with distance education. While online studying helps to account for the fact that every family&#8217;s financial position is unique, education is still crucial.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Unmatchable accessibility</strong>&#8211; </h4>



<p>Even while the world is progressing, there are sadly still some locations that are inaccessible to everyone. The most vulnerable people to this are those with limited mobility. A huge population lives in those areas where it is difficult to have access to education. For those who require that kind of help, adding remote classes to your educational system offers up new possibilities. Lessons that are missed are decreased and learning is improved when students are allowed to learn in environments where they feel comfortable.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Less cost</strong>&#8211; </h4>



<p>The fact that is undeniable is that distance education saves a lot of money and is highly cost-effective. The <strong><a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/">distance learning fee</a> </strong>in NMIMS, for instance, is way less than a normal MBA course.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Reduces travelling pressure</strong>&#8211;</h4>



<p>One big advantage of taking up an online course is that there is no need to go and come back to the college every day which saves a student from a lot of hassle and burden. Online education is more likely to be chosen over traditional classroom instruction by someone who doesn&#8217;t drive or doesn&#8217;t want to spend money on daily transportation expenses. Even teachers can devote more time to teaching their students as their time of going to the institute and moving from one classroom to another is saved.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Here is a pie chart in which the percentage of satisfied students is given</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4SKoG2JMGbGwsuc0kwiXuxf-vHiNlV6OovjVYzczKttBSt6PloK4pRn3CWNEHEd95XaAmvFv0c2fFEdeGyPMfrqqF_uH9c3ONuERhqI1q0fQKKUG8X-uJf9Ur2UpzFt5XhuDTJsOKbiaqrd61V4" alt=""/></figure>



<p>There is no doubt that switching to correspondence courses is anyway more beneficial and convenient than the traditional method of studying. Data suggests that over 32% of students switched to complete distance education from doing one or two subjects through online studies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not only students but also parents are thrilled if their child opts for <strong><a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/">Distance learning courses</a></strong> as the method of acquiring education is highly convenient to them as well. Here are 5 advantages listed that why online courses are highly accepted by parents as well.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. There is no commute</strong>&#8211;</h4>



<p>A lot of parents have to take responsibility for their children so that they can reach college on time and sometimes it gets difficult for them to balance. Owing to such a situation, parents sometimes have to spend extra money or are forced to alter their schedules. Online Courses save parents from such hassles and it is relieving for them.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Reduces expense</strong>&#8211;</h4>



<p>Compared online to the old-fashioned method of learning, the former is fairly economical. One of the reasons why e-learning programs are cost-effective is that they require less time for training (in terms of travel, study materials, trainers, and accommodations). Furthermore, parents are spared the responsibility of covering travel costs when children study at the convenience of their homes.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Responsibilities and self-disciplin</strong>e-</h4>



<p>Online programs require youngsters to be self-starters despite being convenient. There are deadlines to meet even though you study at your own speed and time. The bundle also includes some self-motivation, accountability, and time management abilities. If you can overcome these tendencies, you will advance far in life, the workplace, and other areas. So, this is also one advantage that parents see in such courses and motivate their children to adopt them.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Parents get to know about their children’s circle</strong>&#8211; </h4>



<p>It is possible that you haven&#8217;t yet met everyone in your child&#8217;s large circle of friends. However, you&#8217;ll be more aware of what&#8217;s going on in your child&#8217;s social life if you get to casually observe a digital study session.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Increases the Involvement of Parents-</strong> </h4>



<p>Since students complete their online courses from the comfort of their homes, parents get the opportunity to be directly involved in the studies of their children. Monitoring a child&#8217;s growth and development requires the engagement of the parent. Parents can monitor their children&#8217;s online educational activities if they choose to do so.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Final word</strong></h3>



<p>It can be seen that the online method of learning is widely being adopted and it will continue to be a hit. It enables the learners to progress at their own speed. Everyone needs a comfortable location where they can study without being disturbed. Online education will become more common in the future years as a result.</p>
