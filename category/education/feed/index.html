<p>Were you an “Art Attack” fan? Or somebody who enjoyed “Dora the Explorer”? If yes, then you are in for a treat. Both these examples fit the new and evolving concept of “Edutainment”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But are you wondering what Edutainment is? As per a recent definition, edutainment is a type of entertainment that is intended to both teach and amuse. According to studies, Poor Richard’s Almanack by Benjamin Franklin is considered the earliest account of the field. He created a manual for the laymen that included both fun and instructive materials, such as puzzles and moral guidelines. Later, it is said that Walt Disney used the term edutainment to describe his &#8220;True-Life Adventures&#8221; television series.</p>



<p>So, the concept of entertainment infused in education is not new.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are you Inspired by Sheldon Cooper to Win a Nobel Prize?&nbsp;</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m Not Crazy. My Mother Had Me Tested.&#8221;</em></p>
<cite><em>Sheldon Cooper, Big Bang Theory</em></cite></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="900" height="506" src="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/big-bang-theory.jpg" alt="big bang theory" class="wp-image-11168" srcset="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/big-bang-theory.jpg 900w, https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/big-bang-theory-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/big-bang-theory-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></figure>



<p>Who doesn’t know this super famous dialogue? If you don’t, let’s throw some light on the matter at hand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The dialogue is from an American sitcom, The Big Bang Theory. The show is centred around four friends who are at the top of their careers in Science. Over the period of time, the audience learns that, Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Leonard Hofstadter opted for science because in their childhood, they were inspired by Professor Proton, the children&#8217;s science show host. He used to demonstrate scientific principles using everyday objects. Which is the perfect example of edutainment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another character that was introduced on the TV Show was Bill Nye or popularly known as Bill Nye- The Science Guy. He too, used the tricks of daily life to explain the most complex scientific theories. Additionally, he had his own shows and movies such as “Bill Nye, The Science Guy”; “Bill Nye Saves the World” and others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Evidently, it testifies that when education is clubbed with entertainment, it helps students understand better, they learn the practical aspect of the most difficult concepts and they are also inspired to choose that field as in the case of Sheldon Cooper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the period of time, many video games, toys, innovative websites, and youtube channels have been introduced based on this concept. But, before we look at some of these examples, you should know how much contribution it has made and what’s next in the store. According to market researcher Ambient Insight, revenues from educational-games increased from 2.6 billion USD in 2016 to 7.3 billion USD in 2021.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Learn with John Green and Code with Barbie&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Now that you know what edutainment is, let’s look at some examples that have built and impacted the industry:&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Crash Course&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>With more than 14.6K subscribers, Crash Course is among the most-watched educational youtube channels. Started by John Green and Hank Green, the channel is your shortcut to learning anything and everything. From Economics to Literature to Computer Science, they create short, easy, and intelligible videos that are easily understood by laymen.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>ABC Mouse</strong></h3>



<p>With more than 850 lessons and 9,000 learning exercises, the ABCmouse.com website is an award-winning online resource for kids of the ages 2 to 6. It offers courses in more than 10 distinct levels. Additionally, it offers teachers a fresh approach to teaching subjects. Even higher test scores have been reported by some of the teachers who have employed it. The website has also received “A Teachers&#8217; Choice Award” from Learning Magazine.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Tynker.com</strong></h3>



<p>Tynker or Teach Your Kids to Code is a platform that has incorporated edutainment in its teaching methodology. The platform runs a popular course, that is Coding With Barbie. It uses the iconic fashion doll to teach students of the age seven and above. Additionally, it also has multiple learning tools for parents and teachers.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. <strong>Workbench.com</strong></h3>



<p>Workbench is a dynamic project-based learning system that focuses on full&nbsp; STEAM learning, that is, it caters to Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts, and Mathematics. It offers a variety of entertaining games for all ages across all disciplines. Additionally, it pays special attention to “build, find, customise, and share standards-aligned lessons for your classroom.”</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. <strong>JobSimulatorGame.com</strong></h3>



<p>Launched by Owlchemy Labs, JobSimulatorGame.com focuses on giving users an all-round experience of working on different jobs using virtual reality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The website has already got a spot in Teq.com&#8217;s list of “Edutainment and Entertainment Games to Use in Your Classroom.”</p>



<p>The list does not end here, some of the other examples are: Boulevard, It’s OK to Be Smart, LEGO and others. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="458" src="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/education-entertainment-countinuum.jpg" alt="education entertainment continuum" class="wp-image-11174" srcset="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/education-entertainment-countinuum.jpg 900w, https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/education-entertainment-countinuum-300x153.jpg 300w, https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/education-entertainment-countinuum-768x391.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></figure>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Edutainment: Black or White? Or Grey?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>With every new concept, there come doubts and the question if you can rely on it. Similarly, edutainment has both sides. On one hand students are making the most out of this breakthrough innovation. On the other, there are rising concerns about them growing accustomed to fancy entertainment items to the point where we run the risk of them being dependent on such models for learning. This is largely the reason why some people are sceptical of employing edutainment technologies and material in education.</p>



<p>Let’s look at some other cons of this method:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>As much as the country has progressed, there are still some areas where students don’t have access to technology, mobile phones, or even good wifi connection.&nbsp;</li>



<li>No doubt, smartphones are a distraction. Hence, it might interrupt the learning process.</li>



<li>A greater emphasis on technology and gamification can lead to a complete lack of human interaction between teacher-students as well as peers.</li>



<li>Schools and other learning institutions are yet to adapt and accept this new system.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>On the flip side, “media literacy” is what India is focusing on. Hence, we can not neglect the advantages, which are:</p>



<ol>
<li>With edutainment, it is believed that students will be more engaged.</li>



<li>Digital platforms are a hub of information, students can pick anything that they wish to study.</li>



<li>These platforms are not age-restricted.&nbsp;</li>



<li>It also helps students to explore more and enhance their imagination.</li>
</ol>



<p>Using digital resources in the classroom “helps students master tools they’ll need both personally and professionally to thrive in a tech-based world” as claimed by a research conducted by Tech Edvocate.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Following the Footsteps of South Tapiola High School, Finland</strong></h2>



<p>Though, the question remains the same, “Is society ready to adopt edutainment or do we still have some scruples?” Indubitably, the system is still new, can reach heights, and even do wonders in the education industry. But the way in which education is imparted must change if we are to teach the abilities required to succeed in the 21st century and produce the leaders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a study by Microsoft, the human attention span is just 8 seconds which calls for innovative techniques in the education sectors to hook students. The best example of this is South Tapiola High School, Finland which has an industry-oriented curriculum that caters to the subjects that have been flourishing in the 21st century such as entrepreneurship, active citizenship, and many more. Additionally, the school has collaborated with Microsoft and Dell to incorporate technology into their academics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We live in a world that is fast-paced. Hence, edutainment is not far away.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Do You Think about Edutainment?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Have you tried any edutainment platforms or techniques? If you have what you have to say about it, let us know in the comment section.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if you haven’t, it is definitely a one-time try!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The top trends for the current year include gamification, ed-tech expansion, upskilling, and the emergence of metaverse education models. However, as millennials and young professionals look for ways to improve their competencies and learn in a more efficient, effective, and time-saving manner, &#8220;Nano-learning&#8221; is expected to steal the show. India is rigorously working to execute the goals set by the National Education Policy 2020. Hence, the government has introduced these reforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So far 2023 is the year of transformation, innovation, and internationalisation for higher education in India. The UGC has recently announced two major breakthroughs. One, the declaration that <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/foreign-universities-soon-to-open-campus-in-india/">foreign universities can set up their campuses in India</a>. Second, the establishment of the National Digital University (NDU).&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is National Digital University and How Will it Operate?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>On January 1, 2023, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an announcement about National Digital University. This will help India to expand its roots and even work towards the internationalisation of higher education by means of digitalisation. Thus, making it an attractive study destination for international students.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The National Digital University will start working in the academic year 2023-2024. It will operate with its partner universities which can be either private or public universities. It will function on a “hub and spoke model” where the MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) portal is “the hub” and the partner universities are “the spoke”. Initially, it will offer only certificate and diploma programs and eventually move on to offering degrees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The university will host courses via SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active-Learning for Young Aspiring Minds) and for IT and other administrative services, <em>Samarth</em>, the government portal will be in use.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Digital-University-Infpgraphic-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11037"/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Credit System &amp; Award of Degree</strong></h3>



<p>National Digital University presents to students the chance to earn a degree either from participating higher education institutions or from the National Digital University itself. NDU plans to offer this flexibility through its carefully planned academic &amp; credit system. A student can choose to earn credits from any of the participating institutes. In case a student earns 50% of the credits from any one university and the rest of the credits from any other higher education institute, the student will earn a degree from the respective university.</p>



<p>Let us take an example to understand it better. Let’s say that a student enrols himself for an online course offered by the Delhi University. Now, if the student manages to earn 50% of his/her total credits from Delhi University, then he/she will be awarded a degree by Delhi University.</p>



<p>However, if a student registers at NDU and chooses to earn the requisite credits from different participating universities, then the student will receive the degree from National Digital University. Thus, NDU offers students the freedom to explore and study flexibly.</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the Benefits of National Digital University?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The university aims to solve the following problems:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Private and public universities tend to have a limited number of seats. On the other hand, NDU offers unlimited seats in all the courses</li><li>It focuses on skill development&nbsp;</li><li>It gives the flexibility to earn higher education degrees in online mode</li><li>It contributes towards the “Digital India” movement</li><li>It will increase the overall employability in the country as it will offer many programmes in the emerging areas</li><li>It aims to increase the Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER), with an aim to achieve 50% GER by 2030</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/DU-Infographic-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11038"/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Similarities &amp; Differences Between NDU and Online Learning Platforms&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>National Digital University is no less than online learning platforms like Udemy, SkillShare, and Coursera. The students can browse through a variety of programmes provided in a single discipline and select the one that best suits their educational needs. These platforms and the university only differ in that the latter grants degrees, diplomas, and certificates from recognised Indian universities while the former simply offers e-certifications. </p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Here is a Bird’s-Eye-View of the National Digital University&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Talks about NDU already began in October 2022 as per the <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/education-career/online-education-up-by-179-national-digital-university-soon-to-spike-it-further-ugc-6260413.html">reports of News18</a>. Universities like the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, Delhi University (DU), Banaras Hindu University (BHU), and Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) have been shortlisted to partner with NDU and the UGC is actively looking to expand this list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the rise in digitisation, it is expected that this reform will be a big hit. But, there is still a lot to be done before anything can be said for sure. More clear observations can be seen in the coming months when the university will start offering admissions, student feedback, and active operations.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>&#8220;Communication – the human connection – is the key to personal and career success.” </em></p><cite><em>— Paul J. Meyer.</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>You might have played the game “Chinese Whisper” at your school, college, or workplace? Fun game to play right? But have you wondered about how the sentence gets changed before it reaches the last person? This is because of the lack of effective communication. This game signifies the importance of communication.</p>



<p>Effective communication is very important to convey strong and clear messages. Especially when it comes to running a business, effective communication is crucial to deliver information regarding strategy, customer service and branding. Therefore, it is beyond doubt that communication has the power to improve the efficiency and overall performance of your business significantly.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Can Communication Improve the Business &amp; Workplace?</strong></h3>



<p>Have you watched the world-famous tv series “The Office”? If so you would know what the lack of clear communication in an organisation can do to the organisation. To avoid such unnecessary problems and misunderstandings as occurred between Michael Scott and his squad, clear communication is vital to the growth and sustenance of a business. Clear and effective communication helps deliver a strong message to employees as well as the customer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Communication acts as a catalyst for the growth of the organisation as well as you; as an employee, manager, or business owner. Many times, effective communication has been proven to be vital for the sustenance of a business. Recent research by a US-based company called GARTNER found that almost 70% of an organisation&#8217;s mistakes are caused by the lack of communication. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the top reasons to understand the importance of communication in an organisation:</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. To Avoid Misunderstandings and Conflicts</strong></h4>



<p>Without clear communication, misunderstandings and conflicts may occur and it can hamper the productivity and effectiveness of an organisation. It&#8217;s not all about conveying our message loud and clear but also listing another person, this helps solve the problem and find more efficient solutions.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Facilitates Innovation</strong></h4>



<p>Good communication between employees in an organisation can foster an innovative and creative environment. Innovation and creative thinking help an organisation to grow and climb up the ladder of success. With clear communication, employees can share their ideas with each other and implement the same for a better future. </p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Improve Team Performance</strong></h4>



<p>For employees who possess effective communication skills, building a team and achieving the set goals within the prescribed time will be a cakewalk. Clear communication between team members helps grow as a team as well as an organisation. With collective efforts, it will be easy to find the solutions to the problems that come across the operations in an organisation. </p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Efficient Remote Work</strong></h4>



<p>After the pandemic, most companies have adopted remote and hybrid work settings so that physical communication has been reduced drastically. In the beginning, it was challenging for companies to communicate with the employees, understand their problems, and convey the assigned task. However, many applications and websites like zoom, <a href="https://meet.google.com/">google meet</a> came to the rescue. It became easy to manage employees in a remote setting.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Get Along with the Organisation&#8217;s Goals</strong></h4>



<p>To achieve the organisation&#8217;s goals, it is essential to deliver the mission and vision of the organisation to the employees in an easy-to-understand manner. Most companies set their ethics and work norms to deliver the product and services and it is essential to teach all this to employees. Good communication helps employees to get along with the organisation&#8217;s goals. </p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>10 Important Tips to Develop Good Communication Skills</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tips-to-improve-communication-skills-1-1024x436.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-11033"/></figure>



<p>There is a common misconception that communication only takes place verbally. However, communication is the fusion of verbal, and non-verbal communication, gestures, body language, and many other factors. Therefore, in order to be an effective communicator, one must work on both verbal and written communication as well as overall personality development. Learning better communication helps you increase your and your business&#8217;s productivity and help you excel in your career. Let us quickly glance at some of the important ways to improve communication skills. </p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Body Language&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Through our bad habits or bad posture, our body language falls behind while communicating. The first impression is the last impression and that extends to your first stance. Wrong body language can deliver a wrong perception of the speaker. Therefore, to improve your communication skills, you must focus on your body language. Exhibiting good body language is also an important<a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/job-interview-etiquettes-10-tips-to-impress-employers/"> job interview etiquette</a>.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Be a Good Listener</strong></h4>



<p>In order to become good at communication, you must be a very good listener. While communicating, always try to understand what other people are trying to say and answer accordingly. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Selecting a university for pursuing higher education is the most important step in your career. However, you need to take a lot of things into consideration while selecting a university. For instance, you need to see if the university’s curriculum is aligned with the latest industry standards, whether or not the university is following a modern pedagogy and more importantly whether the university is well-recognised or not. Afterall everyone wants to study at a reputed institute to get an edge in their academic qualification. It makes a great impact in your further educational or professional life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You must have noticed that universities are ranked time and again by many ranking &amp; accreditation bodies on the basis of certain parameters. But what are these rankings? And what does “accreditations” mean? How are they relevant? And why must one take them into account while choosing a university? Let’s find out.</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rankings</strong></h3>



<p>Rankings assess and determine the quality of academics offered by a university. Rankings are basically a useful way to compare the different universities and programmes on the basis of a variety of performance indicators. Even though ranking systems may vary in the parameters that they use for evaluation, each of them assesses the overall performance of the institutes and presents their evaluation report in the form of well-researched data. This data is based on the teaching quality, student and staff ratio, student satisfaction, placements and many other factors.</p>



<p>These rankings identify and determine the best universities in different categories such as Management, Architecture, Pharmacy, Research, Teaching Pedagogy, Placement, etc. The most noteworthy ranking system followed in India is the <a href="https://www.nirfindia.org/2022/Ranking.html">National Institutional Ranking Framework</a> (NIRF). This system was introduced by the Ministry of Education, Government of India to rank higher education institutions in order to differentiate them on several factors and measures. Some other major ranking systems include:</p>



<ul><li>Times Higher Education World University Rankings&nbsp;</li><li>QS World University Rankings</li><li>Academic Ranking of World Universities</li></ul>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Accreditations&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Accreditation can be understood as a “Quality Status” that an institute receives from an evaluating body. The evaluating body confers the status of a given university or school when the respective institute meets the set standards laid by several accrediting agencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Accreditation is not a one-time recognition but it is a continuous process through which the quality of programmes offered at a higher education institute is assessed and verified from time to time to see if they continue to meet the norms and standards that are prescribed by a regulatory body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are different types of educational accreditations in India. Let us have a look at some of the top accreditation one by one:</p>



<ul><li><strong>NAAC: </strong>The <a href="http://naac.gov.in/index.php/en/about-us">National Assessment and Accreditation Council</a> assesses higher educational institutions such as colleges and universities or other institutions in order to check the quality of the curriculum, teaching process, faculty, governance, and teaching resources. The allocation is approved in the form of grades such as A++, A+ and even down to D grade based on the university’s level of performance.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>NBA: </strong>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Board_of_Accreditation">National Board of Accreditation </a>assesses all the technical programs which include engineering &amp; management UG, PG and diploma courses offered by the universities and institutions. The evaluated programs get approval in the form of grades namely: ‘6 years accreditation’, ‘3 years accreditation’ and ‘not accredited’.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>AICTE: </strong>It is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Council_for_Technical_Education">All India Council for Technical Education</a> which assesses and regulates the technical and management universities in India. It is responsible for the planning and development of UG and PG courses in technical and management domains. It also has the authority to grant approval to new technical and management institutions introducing new courses, etc.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>AIU: </strong>It is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Indian_Universities">Association of Indian Universities</a>. It assesses the programs, standards, and syllabi of foreign universities and equates them in relation to various programmes offered by Indian universities.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>DEB: </strong>It is the Distance Education Bureau which is a part of the UGC. It assesses and maintains the standards of distance and open learning in India. It also ensures the smooth functioning of distance education in India.</li></ul>



<p>Other than these, there are many other institutions that provide accreditations in India in specific fields of study. They are Bar Council of India (BCI), Dental Council of India (DCI),&nbsp; All India Management Association (AIMA), to name a few.</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why are Rankings &amp; Accreditations Important?</strong></h3>



<p>Other than acting as a stamp of approval from the government, rankings and accreditations ensure that the curriculum and teaching practices followed by a given institute are at par with government policies, global education standards and current industry trends. They also act as a quality check of an institute. Some of the things that the given rankings and accreditations help you with are:</p>



<ul><li>They act as a basis for comparison between multiple higher education institutes</li><li>They give you an idea of the teaching pedagogy followed at a university, whether it follows a traditional research-based approach or a modern practical-based teaching method&nbsp;</li><li>They help you evaluate the future employability prospects of your degree</li><li>Acts as an indicator of what programme and university meets your requirements</li></ul>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is an Accredited University and Why Should You Choose One?</strong></h3>



<p>Accreditation means reviewing the quality of higher education institutions and the programs that they offer.&nbsp; In the process, a group of experts take time to evaluate and assess the universities in order to showcase their position amongst each other. Therefore, an accredited university will be the one which has been fully reviewed and qualified based upon the set standards.</p>



<p>Accreditation benefits both universities and students. An accredited university readily qualifies for eminent grants and funding which can be utilised to better its infrastructure and academic ecosystem.&nbsp; Accreditation also helps the students and parents to compare and choose the right university and further solidifies their trust in the university. Furthermore, an accredited degree has a competitive edge in the job market.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>The number of universities offering higher education courses is overwhelming. Therefore, rankings and accreditations become imperative as they help you in choosing the right university which is recognised and delivers approved education programmes. Just remember to always thoroughly research a university and see about its rankings and accreditations before taking admission.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On January 5, 2023, the University Grants Commission (UGC) released a draft stating that India is officially open to welcoming foreign universities in the country. This will transform India’s approach to higher education and benefit the students incredibly. But it also raises many questions. How will the government safeguard the interest of our country? Why did this draft not get approval in the previous years? Will foreign universities be given complete autonomy? Are these universities willing to hire Indian professors &amp; teachers? And what does the future of India&#8217;s higher education look like?&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s This Noise About Foreign Universities Entering the Indian Market?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>According to the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/foreign-universities-india-campus-8366318/">UGC report</a>, many <strong>“European Countries”</strong> are interested in expanding their roots in India. The <strong>University of Birmingham</strong> released an official response which said, <em>“We are always open to opportunities for partnership working. We would also point Indian students toward the excellent study opportunities available at the University of Birmingham in both UK and Dubai.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Another college that is<strong> King’s College, London has signed MoU with the government of Telangana</strong> for collaborative research, staff &amp; student exchange, curriculum development, and upskilling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These collaborations and the keen interest of foreign universities in Indian institutions is a testimony to the fact that India is an excellent economy to invest in.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Attracts Foreign Investment in India?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Studies have shown that after the United States, India currently has the second-largest higher education system. Thus, the education sector in our nation has a very high potential for growth. The market for distance education was valued at 39 billion in 2018, and by 2024, it is expected to rise to 360 billion. By the end of 2020, there were more than 988 universities and about 40,000 colleges already established in India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the AISHE stats, the gross enrollment ratio has grown by 0.8%, with a constant increase of 18.2% in female enrollments. This level of growth necessitates significant financial commitment which is not feasible simply through the government. As a result, it encourages and supports investments from the private sector. Furthermore, it promotes foreign direct investment in the sector.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The NEP 2020 Vision</strong></h3>



<p>The latest UGC draft is in line with National Education Policy 2020 (NEP). NEP envisioned the internationalisation of higher education and stated its vision that “top universities in the world will be facilitated to operate in India.” It reflects that the government has thoughtfully taken this action to attract foreign investment in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The UGC Draft</strong></h3>



<p>The draft was announced by the UGC Chairman, Dr. M Jagadesh Kumar which laid down the following key points:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>The universities that are among the top 500 in QS Ranking in the overall category or subject-wise category are eligible to apply in India&nbsp;</li><li>If the universities do not participate in such rankings then they must be reputable in their country</li><li>The foreign university can decide its fee structure, hiring process, admission process, and the Indian government will not have any say in such matters</li><li>The foreign universities can repatriate to their parent university</li><li>The courses offered by these universities should not be against the interest of India’s interests and beliefs&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/MBVi5iFH67Jf8Cca-cvAU0_vVFmExVvYT-2gTEaS7VXX2-UrI_dDWWVyvYT8igVH82QKH0x_8oydlUXJZdwjYNahMV-OiS7n277XKRb7fJTI9HiYE8jOg4jsXs4jUMS5_zs4AOSZrDcX3Vm2RGP20HkLjTjqIMd25Esy59svpFoVfOpeQ_QqbO43Z9IUXQ" alt="" width="737" height="366"/></figure></div>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Have Foreign Universities Received Complete Autonomy?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>According to the official draft, the Indian government will not interfere in matters of foreign universities. They have been given the freedom to set their fee structure for both Indian and international students.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They are also not obligated to follow the reservation system that is popular in India otherwise. Additionally, they can also follow their own process for hiring.</p>



<p>Although the draft did mention that they are advised to include scholarships by Foreign Higher Educational Institution (FHEI). Furthermore, the government has said that the fee structure should be “transparent and reasonable.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ceqTzQgRDlFO6mZvTJwPEKEErLV6Xp7fUCLs9JIDlRerhsFmkPpZri0-DH4lJE8MvBvAYDbykidWTSXb2EvyINaEcP_BpIlGppZdViEecqn6tdAXCPBn6-4_iENeY_jmAgJjiMdVMvCgp9s1bhIVX8Gym4TJm1qVFHWJfVvIgEiG-MMNhzvtRjKQ_QpgJQ" alt="" width="400" height="319"/></figure></div>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How does the Government Safeguard Indian Interests?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The UGC has set the following parameters to safeguard the Indian national interests:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>The UGC can examine the university campuses at any time&nbsp;</li><li>The universities have to abide by India’s anti-ragging and other criminal law policies</li><li>The UGC can suspend or withdraw the university’s approval if its actions are against the policies of India</li><li>The foreign universities have to submit an audit and annual report stating that their working is in line with Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999</li></ol>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How is It Beneficial?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“Presence of Foreign Higher Education Institutions here will enable Indian students obtain foreign qualifications at affordable cost, and make India an attractive study destination.”</em></p><cite>M Jagadesh Kumar, UGC Chairperson&nbsp;</cite></blockquote>



<p></p>



<p>Although it is too early to say anything but majorly the benefits that can be seen of foreign university entering higher education sector in India are:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Foreign students will invest in the courses. Thus, it will directly contribute the country’s GDP</li><li>In order to compete with these universities, IITs, IIMs, private universities will also make necessary changes in their curriculum, opportunities and other procedures</li><li>It is easier for Indian students to study in their dream universities yet stay in the country</li><li>It will also reduce visa and other immigration issues&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>This is broadly what the new UGC policy looks like and in the coming future we will unfold more information. Till then visit our page for more updates.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s colleges have better methods of teaching their students, thanks to the rise of technology. Traditionally, Computer laboratories were available in the majority of classrooms, enabling students to gain required digital literacy skills in preparation for further education and their future employment.</p>



<p>One advantage of technology that the young generation today has is the option of <strong>distance learning</strong>. The idea has no doubt brought fresh ways with which technology can be utilized for teaching the students and the concept has been successful so far, no matter for what level or grades it is used.</p>



<p>Popular and known educational Institutes like NMIMS were already providing distance courses for years and the arrival of the pandemic added fuel to the concept as students got highly comfortable and familiar with the process of taking from home. Now, more and more education seekers are choosing the option of studying from the comfort of their homes and are happily accepting<strong> distance learning courses.</strong></p>



<p>Here are a few advantages of why a student should enrol in distance programs</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Time-saving</strong>&#8211;</h4>



<p>You won&#8217;t need to commute to campus for a distance course or navigate crowded hallways to get to the lecture hall. Consequently, you will have more time for studying and other crucial facets of your life.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Flexible schedules</strong>&#8211;</h4>



<p>Some students have to work to support their families. They also make sure that they complete their education, though. Being able to juggle both is a little simpler with distance education. While online studying helps to account for the fact that every family&#8217;s financial position is unique, education is still crucial.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Unmatchable accessibility</strong>&#8211; </h4>



<p>Even while the world is progressing, there are sadly still some locations that are inaccessible to everyone. The most vulnerable people to this are those with limited mobility. A huge population lives in those areas where it is difficult to have access to education. For those who require that kind of help, adding remote classes to your educational system offers up new possibilities. Lessons that are missed are decreased and learning is improved when students are allowed to learn in environments where they feel comfortable.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Less cost</strong>&#8211; </h4>



<p>The fact that is undeniable is that distance education saves a lot of money and is highly cost-effective. The <strong><a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/">distance learning fee</a> </strong>in NMIMS, for instance, is way less than a normal MBA course.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Reduces travelling pressure</strong>&#8211;</h4>



<p>One big advantage of taking up an online course is that there is no need to go and come back to the college every day which saves a student from a lot of hassle and burden. Online education is more likely to be chosen over traditional classroom instruction by someone who doesn&#8217;t drive or doesn&#8217;t want to spend money on daily transportation expenses. Even teachers can devote more time to teaching their students as their time of going to the institute and moving from one classroom to another is saved.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Here is a pie chart in which the percentage of satisfied students is given</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4SKoG2JMGbGwsuc0kwiXuxf-vHiNlV6OovjVYzczKttBSt6PloK4pRn3CWNEHEd95XaAmvFv0c2fFEdeGyPMfrqqF_uH9c3ONuERhqI1q0fQKKUG8X-uJf9Ur2UpzFt5XhuDTJsOKbiaqrd61V4" alt=""/></figure>



<p>There is no doubt that switching to correspondence courses is anyway more beneficial and convenient than the traditional method of studying. Data suggests that over 32% of students switched to complete distance education from doing one or two subjects through online studies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not only students but also parents are thrilled if their child opts for <strong><a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/">Distance learning courses</a></strong> as the method of acquiring education is highly convenient to them as well. Here are 5 advantages listed that why online courses are highly accepted by parents as well.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. There is no commute</strong>&#8211;</h4>



<p>A lot of parents have to take responsibility for their children so that they can reach college on time and sometimes it gets difficult for them to balance. Owing to such a situation, parents sometimes have to spend extra money or are forced to alter their schedules. Online Courses save parents from such hassles and it is relieving for them.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Reduces expense</strong>&#8211;</h4>



<p>Compared online to the old-fashioned method of learning, the former is fairly economical. One of the reasons why e-learning programs are cost-effective is that they require less time for training (in terms of travel, study materials, trainers, and accommodations). Furthermore, parents are spared the responsibility of covering travel costs when children study at the convenience of their homes.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Responsibilities and self-disciplin</strong>e-</h4>



<p>Online programs require youngsters to be self-starters despite being convenient. There are deadlines to meet even though you study at your own speed and time. The bundle also includes some self-motivation, accountability, and time management abilities. If you can overcome these tendencies, you will advance far in life, the workplace, and other areas. So, this is also one advantage that parents see in such courses and motivate their children to adopt them.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Parents get to know about their children’s circle</strong>&#8211; </h4>



<p>It is possible that you haven&#8217;t yet met everyone in your child&#8217;s large circle of friends. However, you&#8217;ll be more aware of what&#8217;s going on in your child&#8217;s social life if you get to casually observe a digital study session.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Increases the Involvement of Parents-</strong> </h4>



<p>Since students complete their online courses from the comfort of their homes, parents get the opportunity to be directly involved in the studies of their children. Monitoring a child&#8217;s growth and development requires the engagement of the parent. Parents can monitor their children&#8217;s online educational activities if they choose to do so.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2dMetgjF_oI74U_QBUXQi2diD0Kf54a-Tj4SCgZ082MkF19sz5Zsrea6L8UEJ-vChLAulHZenyUEI8gcEabAQCQ45fwo5dOd_UBMJ523uLsD00o2IdrMU-Evd14GDTvD6G5daBuCjDEEuBKDw2Y" alt=""/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Final word</strong></h3>



<p>It can be seen that the online method of learning is widely being adopted and it will continue to be a hit. It enables the learners to progress at their own speed. Everyone needs a comfortable location where they can study without being disturbed. Online education will become more common in the future years as a result.</p>



<p>Because every parent&#8217;s topmost priority is their child&#8217;s growth, parents will also encourage their children to choose online education.</p>
