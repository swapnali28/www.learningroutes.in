<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>When you look at this meme, what do you see?</p>



<p>You see what a butterfly looks like before and after its metamorphosis, right?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ciBxNyTIu83-3GL-uvyeC944iPt17lq0nVTuYZDzv9Oq1_paCGWRFHETorYjZi0va1R8-ByKm3g89Y-vk05q1Vx-sD_6_nlBIkIvmsk9xlP_MeBV2tQkIpHdjbpMLFgThbzdGg0SJEoYy2BeA_aomB8" alt=""/></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Now, take a look at another version of this meme that has suddenly started flooding the internet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/EHgtHSrRZtSPBBXM4Thj5fLj2I9yhvJKPL1r3B9sGXhvke_A59vPjp5pnen93MlGMUah4M-Rg5DZQuk4mMeo91_2d1o-pHyYzb2R6jsS-EA8wqeTl4PT_AAKWadPmjMD3xcOUkhqBWllaa00fHivXZg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>This is what the Twitter logo looked like before, and how it is now!</p>



<p>Curious, right?</p>



<p>Twitter, as we know it, is not the same as it used to be. After the platform was taken over by Elon Musk, there have been many changes introduced to it. There have been lots of controversies around Twitter that have made significant headlines in the papers. Elon, the man behind the Twitter transformation, is wrapped around controversies. Recently, he has added yet another squabble to this list by replacing the Twitter website logo out of the blue. Yes, you heard it correctly, Mush has replaced the blue bird with a dog. And not just any dog, but the dog from the infamous ‘Doge Meme’.</p>



<p>Currently, #TwitterLogo is trending with more than 10K tweets.</p>



<p>But why did Musk do it? When did he do it? Is it some kind of a new prank or an April Fool’s joke?</p>



<p>Are you curious?</p>



<p>So are we!</p>



<p>Let’s explore possible reasons behind this change and its impact on the crypto world.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Happened?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/By_6m2x_bN67y0T4FIQivt3146tdHzjvR_AB7o9hfhJlNotzCgUYHUWmeeHSf1yRuUjFF4wWSVCbBQH8RO380XcipQd-eKoia8RmWRKcgMfwTX8E_49Fd4VfjXcvGvlnGXBLNgHk3NDDZQBz_7QL2uc" alt=""/></figure>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>On April 4th, at 12:20 AM, Elon Musk, Twitter’s current boss, posted this meme on his Twitter handle. Soon Twitter’s logo changed to the image of a dog. But this only happened on the Twitter web platform, not on the mobile application. Furthermore, not just any dog, but the famous dog meme “Doge”. Moreover, you must have heard about dogecoin, a cryptocurrency and a strong rival for Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>



<p>Everyone started to assume it was just a late April Fool&#8217;s prank or he was yet again trying to bring about a surge in the price of DogeCoin.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s Elon’s Reason?</strong></h2>



<p>Elon Musk, the billionaire, philanthropist and Tesla owner, is unpredictable. He does whatever he wants, whenever he feels like.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One fine morning, when you wake up and see a dog instead of a bird on Twitter, you start thinking what might be the possible explanation?</p>



<p>Elon posted a follow-up tweet where he mentioned about keeping an old promise.</p>



<p>Have a look at it:&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zH077b2Uzncx1nwaVieFhagIyEA_-cDZ_ATvjzpry6dkntY9HotC4wbVD1VqlRiRgplDIeWpVPwsO1iLZS56nYm-f2f_IlemfaVNdtutPpOVP5tr82t2cwyxH_nCmSQA9BEiVhhS-XbFqgMC34Dfs88" alt="" width="266" height="303"/></figure>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>A Twitter user “Chairman” suggested Elon to buy Twitter and change its bird logo to a doge.</p>



<p>He posted, “As promised,” with the screenshot of the old thread.</p>



<p>Now people are speculating that there might be another reason behind this change: to promote and boost the value of Dogecoin.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is a Dogecoin?</strong></h2>



<p>Dogecoin or Shiba Inu coin was created as a simple and light alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin is abundant, and more than 10,000 new coins are mined every minute.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Dogecoin has a substantial significance among memers. It is like a meme coin that is loved by its community. Dogecoin is not owned by anyone. However, notable personalities like Mark Cuban, Snoop Dog and Elon Musk have expressed their interest in Dogecoin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to this change, the price of Dogecoin has increased by almost 30% over the past few days.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Lawsuit Against Elon</strong></h2>



<p>In 2022, Dogecoin investors filed a lawsuit against musk, accusing him of driving its price to an all-time high only to let the price fall. Musk’s lawyer defended giving the argument that those tweets about dogecoin were innocuous and silly. Furthermore, it states that his words, such as “Dogecoin Rulz”, and “No highs, no lows, only Doge”, were too vague to claim fraud.</p>



<p>Multiple investors felt they had incurred massive losses by investing in dogecoin, and Elon was the reason behind it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, Musk asked a federal judge to drop the $258 billion lawsuit against him as his tweets were just for fun.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Doge Effect</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7IeMqoYg919QeESS7B0K8MPAZdyfLKi6RcIXpWEcRz9E9Pxoyezz_AiUn7LjmrrB8TswJTquqFWHwh6T8WR6CbbBUoHqIc1me2_f7c4vCC6uAs7bCD3FAtNYxSRQpauTLfJOa0EXJDgApJ1l0JAj9w" alt="" width="395" height="296"/></figure>



<p>The Shiba Inu effect or the Doge effect is a concern for many. When we see doge, we get the idea of the meme, and we tend to laugh. People are concerned about Twitter becoming a joke. After Elon’s takeover, Twitter has seen some rough days; from firing half of its workforce to a buggy feed, it has seen all. Users were upset about the slow performance, monetisation of the blue tick and much more. The sudden pop-up of doge instead of the bluebird is a bit of concern for many. Some speculate that the dog is just a late April fool prank that Musk forgot to pull.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is undebatable that Twitter, after the Musk takeover, is not the same. Elon keeps on altering it and introduces something new every day. Within this short time, he has made more than ten changes to the platform, including changing its logo to Doge. This shows his affection for Doge and how badly he wants to promote it. He wants Doge to overtake Bitcoin and make the coin rule the crypto world.</p>



<p>Now, popular brands are engaging in this doge effect and posting various memes related to these changes.</p>



<p>Here are a few memes made by RealMe:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9tfL_mIsvAknU11DbBx4_XVjlrrWIu0cqtPRJua3TBtN3GbsU4cj-VGiozSoCU3qBLfXS05iT_JEpigGMfk5nfpTXODM0XFMeiX6c2BM3Bq64502lZvZKhrcZBpX9b6ad6lzDzrH2NDTt7oMAcdFOtE" alt="" width="418" height="418"/></figure>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QAVEhX7MwMPJqCqJ1UTy47Fd1_7iMZ8iKgYZlGZYHKUhSW6SQH7TNYGDn7Wgqpswan1Q6KQFYERVFLa4FG4Ojd9UKSGvHvYgECPuwqcc7H7diwL1LdWJRkpYlRxUww6JRf135Ea-UF9HC2nc-wkgNEg" alt="" width="474" height="284"/></figure>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Takeaway</strong></h2>



<p>In conclusion, Elon Musk&#8217;s Twitter icon change to the Doge meme has caused quite a stir among Twitter users and Dogecoin investors. While some speculate that it is just a late April Fool&#8217;s prank, others believe that it is a strategic move by Musk to promote Dogecoin and boost its value. Regardless of his reasons, one thing is sure: Musk&#8217;s unpredictability and willingness to take risks have once again made headlines and sparked conversations. Only time will tell if the Doge effect will have a lasting impact on Twitter and the crypto world.</p>

<p>Do you remember the days when you were a part of a Facebook confession page, where you would share your life experiences? It may be about your workplace, family, college, or anything. You used to pour your heart out on those pages.</p>



<p>Now imagine, you and your boss are on the same page, and you unknowingly confess some not-so-good thing about your boss. That guy reads your confession, and what happens to you the next day?</p>



<p>You are smart enough to guess!</p>



<p>What if I tell you there is a platform where you can write anything you want, whatever you feel, while maintaining your anonymity? Will you agree to post there? I don&#8217;t know about you, but I would use that platform to write out my feelings.</p>



<p>Meet the “Hood” app, India’s first pseudonymous platform, where you can write anything without revealing who you are.</p>



<p>Spooky, right? Let’s dive deeper into the topic and find out more about this intriguing platform.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Zorro: The Anonymous Hero</strong></h2>



<p>Have you seen the 1988’s American film, “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorro">The Mask of Zorro</a>”?</p>



<p>You may have heard about it but might not have seen it. Zorro was the name of the mysterious entity that fought against the Spanish during the Mexican War of Independence. He defended Mexican peasants and commoners from the corrupt governor. What’s most fascinating about this brave hero is that he did all this while maintaining his anonymity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You must be wondering how we reached onto war stories while talking about an anonymous social networking site. That’s because the Hood app was previously named Zorro inspired by the above tale.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Founders</strong></h2>



<p>Jasveer Singh, Abhishek Asthana and Deepak Kumar started Zorro Internet Private Limited with a vision to promote free speech in the cloak of anonymity. Even though the idea of being anonymous is not new for social networking sites, creating a platform that is completely anonymous is quite innovative. Abhishek Asthana realised the need for an anonymous social platform when he used to write anonymously on Twitter under the name Gabbar Singh. The other co-founder, Jasveer Singh has worked with multiple companies, whereas Deepak Kumar has an engineering background and is currently serving as the CTO for the platform.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The App</strong></h2>



<p>The Hood is similar to Twitter except for being pseudonymous. Similar to Zorro, the masked hero, the platform aims to provide people with a space where they are free to express themselves. Moreover, they will not have any fear of being harassed or publicly criticised on social media. According to the founders, everything is on social media, and we are exposed to it. We are judged, criticised, bullied, or trolled whenever we post anything or share our opinion. But with the Hood, you will not be bullied, harassed or trolled. The app&#8217;s most exciting feature is the anonymous groups. You can make college and company groups and express your opinion without anyone knowing your identity.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How It Works?</strong></h2>



<p>As the CEO of Hood claimed, anonymity is a curse; it gives people the licence to bad behaviour. Due to this, multiple social media platforms had to shut down after bullying and fake news became harder to control. Hood counters these problems, as the platform is not entirely anonymous. Instead, you can connect with people in your contacts and interact using a pseudonymous name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The founders wanted to build a platform that is more like Twitter, where the frequency of the posts matters. Hence, in the hood, your feed is constantly getting updated. While signing up, you would be required to provide your mobile number and select a pseudonym. You may also connect your profile to Twitter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best part is that all the posts on the Hood are posted under your pseudonymous name, and no one can reach you directly. The content on the Hood is moderated through a “Sensitive Content” disclaimer.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Shark Tank</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="559" src="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hood-app-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11202" srcset="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hood-app-1.jpg 900w, https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hood-app-1-300x186.jpg 300w, https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hood-app-1-768x477.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></figure>



<p>Hood gained popularity when it was aired in the second season of Shark Tank. In the fortieth episode, the three founders asked for INR 1.2 Crores for 0.2% equity of the company valuing it at INR 600 crores. The founders claimed that the users&#8217; data are encrypted using 256-bit encryption techniques, At that time, the app had over 7.7 lakhs users. The app has around 2.4 lakh active users, and around 6,000 posts are posted daily. Moreover, about 1,800 new threads are created on the platform every day. Shark Aman Gupta and Peyush Bansal made a combined offer of INR 60 lacs for 0.54% equity of the company and INR 60 lacs debt at a 12% interest rate at a valuation of 112 crores.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, Hood raised $3.2 million in a seed funding round led by VC firms 3one4 Capital and 9Unicorn Ventures. The company also has backing from some notable investors such as Vijay Shekhar Sharma, CEO of Paytm; Kunal Shah, CEO of CRED; Ritesh Aggarwal, CEO of OYO and many more.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>



<p>The world has become smaller with the advancement of technology and social media. You think multiple times before posting content, as what you post impacts your relationship with your friends, families, neighbours and colleagues. Hood eliminates this issue by giving you the power of pseudonymity. Students, teachers, workers, entrepreneurs, basically everyone can write anything without worrying about its consequences. No one will be able to track, hurt, bully, or identify you. It could beat the monopoly of Twitter and even challenge Meta. Thus, if you are worried about what your boss might do if he reads your confession about the workplace, you don’t need to worry; just Hood it.</p>
