<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Global Recession 2023</strong></h3>



<p>According to the leading economic research organisations, the world is going to face a global recession by the year 2023. The upcoming uncertainty around the global recession makes one wonder about the jobs that will stay unaffected by it. Young people entering the workforce are using their resources to develop recession-proof skills to shine in their respective careers. There are various sectors that do not get affected by the recession. The growth rate in these sectors does not decrease. Some of the sectors that will remain unaffected by the global recession 2023 are:-&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Medical and Healthcare</strong></h4>



<p>Our physical and mental healthcare does not care about what is going on with the economy. It is certain that in a global recession, the healthcare industry does not get affected. For instance, in times like COVID Pandemic &#8211; healthcare and wellbeing industry benefited the most while the other industries lagged behind. This industry offers the maximum job security to the workforce. In India, this industry contributes 5% to the GDP and is expected to rise at 22.87% in the following years.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Education&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>The education industry is one such industry that stays intact no matter how much the economy is affected. The education sector experiences a boost as many people return to schools and colleges to continue their education. Nowadays, open and distance learning has also emerged drastically. By 2025, the distance education industry is expected to rise by 2.28 Billion USD.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Public Utility</strong></h4>



<p>Workers in the utility sector enjoy a certain amount of job security even in the time of recession. The utility sector consists of electricity, water, internet services and waste management and these services are still required by the people even when the economy is in recession.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. <strong>Credit and Debt Management Counsellors</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Credit and Debt management becomes important especially during recession.&nbsp; People consult counsellors for smart management of their finances. Services of management counsellors are in great demand during the time of global recession.&nbsp; The industry can experience considerable growth during the period of global economic stagnation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. <strong>Consumer Packaged Goods Services&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>The consumer and packaged goods industry is the staple of any consumer. Especially the consumers that are young in age as they tend to become more reliant on packaged goods. The packaged goods are usually staple items and people will buy these goods and items even at the time of economic slowdown. This is usually the reason why this sector is not bound to really face the repercussions of the global recession. People working in this industry will not be influenced by recession. In Fact, in the year 2020, that too during the pandemic, the industry experienced a growth rate from 108.1% to 108.8%.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The IT Industry and the Global Recession&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>In the year 2020-21, the IT industry saw an exponential growth of 12%. According to the World Bank, 2023 will witness an increase in global inflation rate by 5%. As the world will be facing the global economic slowdown in 2023, the jobs in the IT sector are considered to be least affected by the recession. The reason for believing such an effect on the IT industry is the recent drop in the attrition of the Indian softtech-giant Infosys by 27.1%. Due to our increasing reliance on digital means for daily functions, the IT industry is experiencing a boom holistically. The big IT firms like Infosys, TCS and Wipro have bagged great deals with international enterprises. According to Kotak Institutional Equities, ‘<em> Tech spending continues to be a vital area of focus as banks and financial services firms are in the early stages or in the midst of a tech upgrade journey.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The growth in the Information Technology sector can be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic as most of the workspaces went digital. The IT industry saw a boom in the years 2020 and 2021. The pandemic compelled people to develop recession-proof skills like communication, Remote Project Management and flexibility. It was believed that after the pandemic, our reliance on IT services will decrease, however, the recent statistics point to the opposite. According to the Bureau of Labour Statistics, tech-related jobs are all set to grow in the next decade. Within the IT industry, there are certain job profiles that are considered to be recession-proof as well as highly rewarding at the times of global recession.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A business development executive is a valuable addition to any company. A skilled BDE can bring in new business and boost a company&#8217;s prospects. A BDE&#8217;s main responsibility is to generate leads for companies in e-commerce, retail, pharma, FMCG, electronics, clothes and fashion, cosmetics, furniture, aerospace, manufacturing, chemicals, and other fields. You will be able to meet your business goals on time if you engage a motivated BDE who is professional in their approach to work. Following proper recruiting practices is the key to selecting the perfect BDE for your firm. Only experts with the proper talents, behavioral qualities, and subject expertise will enter your workforce if you have a competitive recruitment strategy in place.</p>



<p>In most cases, a <strong>Business Development Executive</strong> performs the same duties as a Sales Executive or an Account Executive. In the end, this person is in charge of selling a product or service directly to clients. These customers could be other businesses (B2B sales) or individual customers (Business-to-Consumer, or B2C sales).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Business Development Executive, in particular,&#8230;</strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>Creates long-term value for a company through customers, markets, and partnerships.</strong></li><li><strong>Focuses on expanding the company — they investigate possible growth prospects, then assist and supervise their execution.</strong></li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Typical Business Development responsibilities include:</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Using networks and online research, identify and qualify new sales leads.</li><li>Follow up on any sales leads, clearly providing pertinent facts.</li><li>Use telephone, email, and internet contact to build and maintain strong connections with new and existing partners.</li><li>Become a product expert and be able to effectively present the company&#8217;s items to current and new customers.</li><li>Meet sales targets and KPIs on a weekly and monthly basis.</li><li>Attend conferences, meetings, and industry events on behalf of the company.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Putting this part into context&#8230;</strong></h2>



<p><strong>EXAMPLE: </strong>Business Development Executives are employed by a digital marketing business to find and contact potential organizations that might be interested in purchasing digital marketing services. The BDEs will conduct research on firms, analyze their present digital marketing activities, and build relationships with them (most likely via phone and email), recommending ways in which the agency may assist them in improving their digital marketing efforts. They&#8217;ll then keep solid working connections with clients, offering them add-ons and enhancements whenever available, and continually looking for methods to add value and grow the company!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Business Development Executive should have the following core abilities and experience:</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Be an expert in the company&#8217;s products and be able to sell them successfully in any situation.</li><li>Be able to demonstrate a thorough understanding of the company&#8217;s industry and markets.</li><li>Have a knack for selling and recognising business opportunities.</li><li>Have an excellent understanding of (or willingness to learn about) customer relationship management (CRM) systems like Salesforce.</li><li>Feel at ease in a goal-oriented environment and endeavour to overcome any obstacles that may prevent targets from being fulfilled.</li><li>Demonstrate effective time management and planning abilities.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Career path:</strong></h2>



<p>To work in Business Development, you must be an excellent communicator, as previously said. Previous sales or customer service experience is a wonderful method to show that you have this talent as well as a customer-centric mentality. A business degree can also help because it demonstrates that you understand corporate goals and settings.</p>



<p>When it comes to advancement, it&#8217;s normal for a BDE to be promoted to a BDM (Business Development Manager). Taking on additional responsibility for the planning and development of the company&#8217;s growth strategy is likely if you move into this position. You can also expect to be in charge of evaluating the effectiveness of the business development team and managing more junior employees.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Alternative job titles and related roles:</strong></h2>



<p>While positions may have various titles and be located in slightly different departments, many of the same tasks apply to them. Anyone embarking on a job hunt should be aware that roles sometimes overlap, so read job descriptions carefully and perform your own study into specific positions to see if they&#8217;d be a good fit for you. Here are some job titles with responsibilities that are typically quite similar to those of a Business Development Executive to give you an idea of the range available&#8230;</p>



<ul><li>Strategic Account Manager/Executive</li><li>Business Development Representative</li><li>Client Relations Executive</li><li>Sales Executive/Representative</li></ul>

<p>Have you ever had to go through an MBA Job Interviews question asked by hr? If you haven&#8217;t already, I&#8217;m sure you will sooner or later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To assist you in your preparation, we&#8217;ve put together a blog that covers some of the most commonly asked HR interview questions and answers.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/">Learning Routes</a> provides you expert advice and topper&#8217;s personal experience insights on top MBA personal interview questions for Jobs 2021, which will help you ace the interview phase.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Personal &#8211; MBA INTERVIEW QUESTIONS</strong></h2>



<p>The questions for an MBA job interview are divided into two segments, according to our&nbsp;experts. One deals with the candidate&#8217;s personal or personality attributes, while the other aids the interviewer/interviewers in determining the candidate&#8217;s managerial and interpersonal knowledge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Top MBA questions asked during the personal interview round:</p>



<p><strong>Question 1.  Could you please give a quick introduction to yourself? Tell us about yourself in a unique way.</strong><br><strong>Answer- </strong>The subject of how to introduce yourself is one of the most prevalent interview questions. This is an open-ended question.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Only if candidates know how and in what tone to respond to the first question do they have a good chance of gaining the interviewer&#8217;s trust.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>The response should take no more than 2-3 minutes, but it should include all relevant information.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Candidates must demonstrate that they are well-informed about themselves and can articulate that knowledge.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Question 2.  Describe yourself in 03 words.&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Answer &#8211;</strong> Be succinct in your response and use any three adjectives that best describe you.&nbsp;<br>Be self-assured enough to provide three captivating words about your personality that will wow the interviewer or the interviewing panel.&nbsp;<br>Instead of being overly simplistic, candidates can use synonyms to discover fascinating words.</p>



<p><strong>Question 3.  What have you learned thus far from your failures?&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Answer &#8211;</strong> Recognize that it&#8217;s okay to make errors and learn from them. Do not be embarrassed to talk about your failure.&nbsp;<br>Prepare to answer this question, as well as any others connected to failure, because such inquiries are used to assess candidates&#8217; tolerance levels.&nbsp;<br>When addressing or explaining your failure, don&#8217;t come out as broken or disappointed.&nbsp;<br>Instead of focusing on what you&#8217;ve lost, try to concentrate on what you&#8217;ve gained.</p>



<p><strong>Question 4. What are some of the flaws that you&#8217;re working on?&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Answer &#8211;</strong> Instead of diving right into your negative attributes, start with something nice.&nbsp;Demonstrate to the interviewer how you can channel negative energy.&nbsp;<br>If you opt not to answer this question, it may indicate that you are too shy to address things freely.&nbsp;<br>Concentrate more on how you&#8217;re conquering your negative traits, and how much extra effort you&#8217;re putting in to turn the bad into the good.</p>



<p><strong>Questions 5.  Do you have any objectives in mind? Goals over the next five years or ten years?&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Answer </strong>&#8211; In these types of questions, applicants can state their objectives in detail. Begin with a one-year goal and work your way up to five and ten-year plans. Don&#8217;t be hesitant to respond to these questions. People have objectives. Remember APJ Abdul Kalam&#8217;s words: &#8220;You must dream before the dream comes true.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em><strong>Are you looking for MBA Program? <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/nmims-distance-mba/">Join NMIMS Distance MBA Learning Program</a></strong></em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Top MBA Personal Interview Questions for Managers:&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Question 6.  &#8211; According to you, what is the one managerial trait that all managers must possess?&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Answer</strong> &#8211; Don&#8217;t jump to that one attribute right away. List the traits of a manager, such as leadership, communication, decision-making, reliability, and integrity, and then elaborate on the one managerial quality that you believe is the most important. While elaborating about management quality, try to use concise language. Answering this question gives you a chance to talk about something you&#8217;re more passionate about.</p>



<p><strong>Question 7.  Have you ever demonstrated that you are a good manager?&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Answer</strong> &#8211; Because you are applying for an MBA program, the panel may ask you about a time when you had to act as a manager or accept responsibility for something good during the personal interview stage. Make sure you have a good example to back up your answer.</p>



<p><strong>Question 8.  Please elaborate on your achievements. Is there a time when you stood out as a manager and took charge?&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Answer</strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s simple to come up with positive attributes or achievements. Some candidates, on the other hand, may find it difficult to put their feelings into words. Answer MBA job interview questions regarding your achievement, its impact on your life, your experience, what you gained from that accomplishment, and so on. Also, discuss the initiatives you took and the lessons you learned along the way.</p>



<p><strong>Question 9.  Do you believe you will be unable to work with certain types of people in the future?&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Answer</strong> &#8211; Maintain your composure and answer this question in a fair tone, no matter how desperate you are to answer or disclose the other side of the coin by diminishing any other person or personality. A candidate could wind up showing himself or herself in a negative light as a result of doing so.</p>



<p><strong>Question 10.  Elaborate decision-making.</strong><br><strong>Answer</strong> &#8211; Study managerial terms and their definitions, and try to make conclusions for the words ahead of time. This is only an example to demonstrate the importance of managerial words to the candidates. The subject could be anything. Make sure you understand the managerial terms and give a detailed response. You won&#8217;t get through the MBA personal interview stage with one-liners.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Advanced Interview Techniques for MBA Personal Interviews&nbsp;</strong><br>If you are scheduled for a personal interview, basic etiquette such as formal attire, punctuality, and hygiene are required. Candidates can boost their chances of selection by following the guidelines below in addition to the standard etiquettes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tips for Personal Interview Round:</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Be Well Prepared (aware of must-know questions)</td><td>Listen Attentively and Respond</td></tr><tr><td>Be polite</td><td>Maintain proper non-verbal communication</td></tr><tr><td>Body Language should be positive</td><td>Drive Answers to Your Strengths</td></tr><tr><td>Go for Advanced SWOT Analysis</td><td>Be Informative and Keep Answers Short Unless Required (in open-ended questions)</td></tr><tr><td>Be positive and Reflect the same</td><td>Be Honest While Answering</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><strong><em>Certainly, the above-mentioned questions cannot be guaranteed to be asked during the personal interview stage. Candidates, on the other hand, can take a concept and prepare themselves ahead of time. The MBA interview questions will be full of surprises, just like life. Just maintain your composure and self-assurance. Don&#8217;t be in a hurry to respond. To begin, comprehend the question and the response.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p>A person&#8217;s career is a life decision. It helps you develop your individuality by giving you independence and self-assurance. It is impossible to undo the years of effort and money invested in pursuing an education option. As a result, we must be extremely cautious while selecting a job route.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em><strong>The following are five suggestions to assist you in making an informed career decision:</strong></em></p>



<p><strong># Tip 1: Understand your aptitude and interests:</strong> It is critical that we not only investigate other employment alternatives, but also our own interests, aptitudes, skills, and shortcomings. Self-awareness leads to better professional choices, and hard work looks to be effortless. There are various approaches to determine your ability and interest.&nbsp;Taking psychometric career tests, which provide an indicated career profile, is a common and reliable strategy. In industrialized countries, this strategy is often utilized to begin the career exploration process.</p>



<p><strong># Tip 2: Keep a Career Journal:</strong> Keep a career diary and jot down all of the career alternatives that interest you. Make a list of all the questions you have about it. Make a list of what you hope to get out of your dream job. Writing will help you identify your career goals clearly and ask the proper questions about them. It will prepare you for the <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/career/">career</a> of your dreams. Make it a habit to do so.</p>



<p><strong># Tip 3: Do some research on eligibility requirements:</strong> Each job path has its own set of requirements. Eligibility criteria include age, education, subject requirements, and physical characteristics such as vision, height, and weight. It&#8217;s critical to meet these requirements if you want to pursue your chosen job path. Female flight attendants, for example, must be at least 5 feet 3 inches tall and weigh 58-70 kilograms to be considered for the position of air hostess. Male flight attendants must be between 5 and 6 feet 3 inches tall and weigh between 68 and 82 kilograms. If you don&#8217;t meet these requirements, you won&#8217;t be able to work as an air hostess or flight attendant. Learn about these criteria before choosing your dream career option.</p>



<p><strong># Tip 4: Be familiar with &#8216;A Day in the Life of&#8217;:</strong> Many times, we become attracted by the portrayal of a career based on what we see on television and in movies, but this does not always have to be a real representation of what we would be asked to do on the job. It&#8217;s critical that you do your homework, ask questions, and gather information about what a &#8216;day in the life of a particular career option will entail. Don&#8217;t just ask how much money you can make in a particular career option; instead, find out how many hours you&#8217;ll be expected to work, what kind of work you&#8217;ll be doing, who you&#8217;ll be dealing with, and so on.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong># Tip 5: Consult with a Career Counselor: </strong>Why do we fail to seek advice from a job counselor and discuss our options and seek their opinions when we are preparing to watch a movie or check out ratings and reviews of a new restaurant we are about to dine in? After all, deciding on a career path is a high-stakes decision. You will be better prepared for the future if you seek a professional counselor on a regular basis, and you will be able to make more educated decisions.</p>



<p>These are the five most helpful hints for picking the proper professional path.&nbsp;</p>
