<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the Scenario of the Job Market in 2023?</strong></h3>



<p>The job market is bound to change constantly due to the changing needs and technology in the world and thus, it becomes difficult to figure out how to prepare for a job at the right time. There was a tremendous change in the job market during and post-pandemic as there were a great number of layoffs, shortage of jobs, and an increased unemployment rate. But the post-pandemic era also lured us with newer jobs and changing work trends like working from home was the “new normal” and till date many companies encourage it. But as we are reaching the end of 2022, what will be the scenario of jobs in 2023?</p>



<p><strong>As of 2022, many new employment opportunities in the IT, real estate and health sectors are seen with the IT sector leading the race. FY2022 recorded a 15.5% growth which was the highest ever, reaching USD 270 billion in revenue. It is also seen as a year of tech startups. </strong>A trend that will definitely see a significant boost in 2023 is a shift from theoretical knowledge to a focus on soft skills. An employer would likely hire somebody who can crack that code, build a strong strategy or create amazing graphics. Employers will tend to seek employees who have strong communication skills, problem-solving abilities and team-building abilities because these qualities reflect adaptability and flexibility in an ever-changing workplace. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5 Tips to Become Job Ready in the Changing Job Market:</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Understanding the Current Job Market and Trends</strong></h4>



<p>Since the job market is bound to evolve with changing times, it becomes crucial to stay up-to-date with the changing trends. Hence, research plays a very important role when it comes to understanding the job market. For instance, it helps to understand which trend might last more than 10 years. One such example is:  post-pandemic people started preferring remote or work from home and this trend is likely to persist in the coming years. There are even more diverse modes of work emerging such as freelancing, contract projects and much more. Many people are finding self-employment to be a better option than working from the office. It, therefore, becomes obvious that the current job market demands you to be flexible at work and tech-savvy. </p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Explore Newly Evolving Fields</strong></h4>



<p>India has a mixed economy which makes it an attractive country for many diverse job sectors. But, it was seen that India’s economy was sick before the coronavirus crisis and it went even more down during the pandemic. The pandemic also brought about the scenario of online systems and the boost in sectors like digital marketing which is evolving drastically and thereby is creating newer job opportunities.

According to Business Standards, “Two-thirds<strong> of Indian knowledge workers are likely to switch jobs in 2023.” </strong>Additionally, studies have also shown that Indian<strong> gaming will add up to 1 lakh jobs in the year 2023. </strong></p>
