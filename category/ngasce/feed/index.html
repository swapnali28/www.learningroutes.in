<p>The quest for new, better, and cost-effective means of delivering education and training is intensifying worldwide. Open and distance learning has gained tremendous popularity in the past few years. <strong>Studies have shown that by the year 2026, the market size is expected to reach INR 325.48 billion as compared to INR 91.41 billion in the year 2020.</strong> For those who were unable to complete their education for certain constraints or want to pursue further studies in any field, distance education gives them the chance to continue their studies or upgrade themselves with some professional course to get better career opportunities and land lucrative jobs.&nbsp;</p>
