<p>According to Coursera <em>“An Executive MBA (EMBA) is an advanced business degree program designed for professionals who are about 10 to 15 years into their careers.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/nmims-executive-mba-wx-programs/">NMIMS’ executive MBA</a> is a 24-month course that is thoughtfully crafted and packed with skill-based knowledge. The university offers five specialisations in this course, namely: &#8211;&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Marketing</li><li>Digital Marketing</li><li>Applied Finance</li><li>Operations and Supply Chain</li><li>Leadership and Strategy</li></ol>



<p>Moreover, they have collaborated with Harvard Business School&nbsp; to provide an optional certificate course for value addition, thus, exposing students to the global education system.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is Executive MBA Better than MBA?</strong></h3>



<p>You must be wondering why an Executive MBA is better than an MBA. There are a lot of similarities in the course such as duration, application process, test requirements, etc. but EMBA has an edge because the individual already has 10 to 12 years of corporate experience so as to build something of his own.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>According to Caryn L. Beck-Dudley, the president and CEO of AACSB International, the enrollment in executive courses has increased to 68%.</em></strong> This degree is meant for working professionals who want to land leadership positions in organisations. It is an ideal way to give a push to your career if you are at a standstill.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Final Thoughts&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>We are sure you can come up with many reasons and examples saying a management degree is not necessary but we are saying that an MBA or an Executive MBA can help accelerate the process. You get to build a network, learn how theoretical knowledge can be executed to practical projects. Through the capstone projects and internships students learn how to work in a team which is imperative to build a business.&nbsp;</p>
