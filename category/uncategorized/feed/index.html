This programme caters to build great networking opportunities with high-level executives from a variety of industries.</p>



<p>An <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/nmims-executive-mba-wx-programs/">Executive MBA</a> or an EMBA holds a lot of similarities with a regular MBA degree, but is basically designed keeping in mind the unique needs of working professionals, business leaders and corporate employees who aim to improve their knowledge while they are still employed. An EMBA programme provides a comprehensive view of the organisation to its students, guides them to deal with the complex structures of the organisation and inculcates in them a deeper know-how of the business processes. </p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Eligibility Criteria</strong></h3>



<p>In order to pursue an EMBA, the person should be eligible as per the requirements. The admissibility for the same can be discussed as follows: <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>The individual who wants to do an EMBA should have a graduation degree or a master’s degree from a recognised institution. He should possess a minimum of 50% in his highest qualification. The minimum marks required vary from university to university.&nbsp;</li><li>He should have adequate work experience which is generally around 2-3 years.&nbsp;</li><li>The candidate should have excellent communication skills and should be proficient in the English language.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>*Note: Most universities don’t go for entrance exams, however, it depends on the university whether or not an entrance exam is required.</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Course Duration</strong></h3>



<p>It takes around 24 months to complete a distance EMBA program which has about 4 terms or semesters. However, the duration for a distance Executive MBA varies for different institutes. In some universities, it lasts for a year while in others, the course is of a 2-year duration. </p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fee Structure</strong></h3>



<p>The course fee varies depending on the college, duration of the course and many other factors. However, the average fee ranges from INR 50,000 to INR 5 lac for the entire course.

There are also many universities and B- schools that conduct various scholarship tests to make the course more economical. </p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Executive MBA: Specially Crafted for Working Professionals</strong></h3>

<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Distance EMBA vs Regular MBA</strong></h3>



<p>Both regular MBA and distance EMBA are quite similar but there are certain distinctions which make them different from each other. So, here are some key differences between the two:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Flexibility</strong>: </h4>



<p>In a distance EMBA course, the aspirants have a flexible learning schedule, self-paced learning and the advantage of learning while doing work. On the other hand, in the case of a regular MBA, one has to be physically present in the classes. </p>



<div style="height:2px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Course Duration:</strong></h4>



<p>A distance EMBA course can have a comparatively shorter duration as compared to a regular MBA programme. </p>



<div style="height:2px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Work Experience:</strong></h4>



<p>An adequate work experience of around 2-5 years is a prerequisite for pursuing a distance EMBA course. While for a regular MBA degree work experience may or may not be a necessary precondition.</p>



<div style="height:2px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. <strong>Fee Structure:</strong></h4>



<p>A distance EMBA course has comparatively less fees as compared to a regular MBA course.</p>



<div style="height:2px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. <strong>On the basis of Learning:</strong></h4>



<p>The curriculum of a regular MBA is covered by highly educated and skilled professors who hold expertise in their fields. But, in an EMBA the aspirants are taught by professors who have intensive knowledge about their specialisation and industry experts who provide them with real-time business world experiences. Moreover, the EMBA curriculum is more practical-oriented as compared to a regular MBA.</p>



<p>Therefore, an EMBA is a course that is an ideal choice for working professionals which will help them to enhance their skills and knowledge, while they are at work. Whereas, a regular MBA is for students who are willing to attend regular classes for doing an MBA programme.</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Salary Expectations</strong></h3>



<p>EMBA is one of the most premiere courses around the globe and provides you with innumerable job opportunities and high designations with higher salaries. The remuneration criteria vary depending upon a lot of factors.</p>



<p>The average salary packages of different EMBA courses can be classified as follows:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Brand Manager- INR 14 Lac per annum</li><li>Operations Director- INR 30 Lac per annum</li><li>Senior Accountant- INR 4 Lac per annum</li><li>HR Executive- INR 5 Lac per annum</li></ul>



<p>Apart from these, aspirants get a chance to work in various reputed job profiles such as Senior Business Analyst, Management Consultant, Business Development Manager, Brand Manager, etc. These job profiles provide you with a great learning experience and increase your horizons in the business world. Additionally, the perks and emoluments they offer are huge, both in quantitative as well as qualitative aspects. </p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Takeaway&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>When it comes to making a career in supply chain management, you have the option to work with food, furniture and many other industries in future. But entering this field is not a simple task. Managing the flow of materials from source to final product requires a lot of knowledge, skill and experience. The job may not bring in a hefty paycheck but it provides development opportunities.</p>



<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Does Supply Chain Management Mean?</strong></h3>



<p>The process of supply chain management involves planning, organising and overseeing the flow of products, information, and funds between suppliers, manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers. It entails coordinating and integrating these processes to guarantee that goods are produced and supplied as effectively and economically as possible.</p>



<p>Several tasks are included in supply chain management, such as locating raw materials and components, controlling inventory levels, organising logistics, and managing interactions with suppliers and clients. Additionally, it addresses the movement of data and money along the entire supply chain, including keeping track of orders and payments. Additionally, it assures that all individuals get access to the data they require to make rational decisions.</p>



<p>A business can increase efficiency, save expenses, and improve customer satisfaction through effective supply chain management. Moreover, it can make a company more adaptable to shifting market dynamics, client demand, and supply chain interruptions.</p>



<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is a Supply Chain Manager?</strong></h3>



<p>A supply chain manager directs and organises the processes associated with moving products, data, and money throughout a supply chain. This includes arranging for the manufacturing of items and their delivery, managing interactions with suppliers and clients, and managing logistics.</p>



<p>A supply chain manager can choose and identify suppliers, negotiate contracts, and control inventory levels. They could also be involved in setting up and managing carriers, keeping an eye on delivery schedules, and ensuring that things are delivered promptly and in good condition.</p>



<p>A supply chain manager may oversee the flow of information and money along the supply chain and control physical movements and logistics. This can entail keeping track of orders, collecting payments, and ensuring everyone has the data they need to make wise choices.</p>



<p>Any organisation&#8217;s success depends on efficient supply chain management, and to ensure that, supply chain managers are crucial. They make sure that items are produced and distributed efficiently and economically.</p>



<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5 Reasons to Study Supply Chain Management</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Improved Efficiency</strong></h4>



<p>Finding methods to streamline procedures and boost productivity within a global network of suppliers, producers, warehouses, and distribution hubs is the goal of supply chain management. This frequently necessitates locating and resolving complex supply chain issues. A supply chain manager can figure out how to shorten lead times, increase delivery accuracy, or lower inventory levels, for instance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Supply chain experts are able to assess data, create and evaluate choices, and make decisions that consider the trade-offs and restrictions present to handle these difficulties. These are important problem-solving abilities that may be used to address various commercial and organisational issues, both inside and outside the supply chain industry.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Post-Covid Shift in Supply Chain</strong></h4>



<p>Global supply chains were proven by COVID-19 to be extremely strained and exposed to disruptions, with each break affecting the entire economy. Logistics in a post-COVID future will prioritise cutting supply chains and ensuring that items are transported across endpoints more quickly to foster higher resilience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to the lack of suppliers during the pandemic, businesses were obliged to hunt for local supply chains to supplement shipments from abroad. In a post-COVID scenario, logistics players will encourage their current local suppliers to accept bigger volumes across various product lines. Thus creating a sudden boom in the logistics industry with rapid growth in the upcoming years.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Career Opportunities</strong></h4>



<p>Businesses of all sizes and in all sectors need to manage their supply chains effectively because it saves costs, boosts productivity, and enhances their overall ability to compete. Consequently, there is a great need for specialists in supply chain management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Logistics, purchasing, and operations management are among the top career options in supply chain management. These experts control the movement of products, services, and information along a supply chain and ensure that they are delivered on time and efficiently. Studying supply chain management can equip you with the abilities and information necessary to be successful in a range of positions within the industry, helping you prepare for a career in one of these fields.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. <strong>Government Role</strong></h4>



<p>Government and public sector organisations are utilising supply chain management to their total capacity to provide value to the public more effectively and efficiently. Mission-ready firms ensure that operations and supply chain management techniques are set up for success, installing various storage facilities across the nation, enabling them to thrive today and in the future to remain resilient in times of change. </p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Interdisciplinary Skills</strong></h4>



<p>It takes a combination of technical, business, and analytical abilities to study supply chain management. Knowledge of logistics, transportation, and distribution systems, as well as an awareness of supply chain software and tools, are some of the technical skills acquired during the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Negotiating contracts with suppliers, managing stakeholder relationships and analysing data to find the scope for improvement are all crucial business skills that may be developed while studying supply chain management. The study of supply chain management can help students acquire vital analytical skills such as problem-solving, data interpretation and analysis, and data-driven decision-making.</p>

<p>Getting a new job is a special moment for you. You always want to give your best whenever you are applying for a job or appearing for an interview. Whether you are a fresher or an experienced professional, there is always an astounding nervousness to face the recruiter. You wish to stand out among all the other candidates but are not sure how to prepare yourself. But don’t worry. In this blog, we are going to tell you how to prepare yourself for job interviews.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>10 Tips to Impress Employers&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Preparing for an interview might seem to be time-consuming as you need to remember a lot of things. There are a few important tips that you need to be well aware of in order to crack the interview and impress the employer. Let&#8217;s try to understand the important job etiquettes for an interview that you should keep in mind. These job interview tips will surely help you clear the interview &amp; land your dream job.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Research Well About the Company:&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>It is crucial to research about the company that you want to get in and see whether it suits your aspirations,&nbsp; lifestyle and career goals. You can easily get to know about the company by browsing its website, and social media profiles or by contacting any other professionals who are already working there. The primary things to remember while researching about the company are:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>How is the work culture of the company</li><li>What are the company’s mission, vision and future goals</li><li>What are the reviews given by the working professionals of the company</li><li>Leave &amp; increment policies</li></ul>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Pay Attention to Your Body Language:&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>The right body language marks a great first impression on the recruiter and shows your confidence. Thus, you should pay attention to your body language by:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Maintaining eye contact with the recruiter to show that you are attentive in the interview and are not shying away</li><li>Keeping a smile on your face while answering the questions in the interview</li><li>Listening first and then answering by taking a short pause</li><li>Practise your body language in front of the mirror before the interview</li><li>Showing your enthusiasm by making good expressions &amp; gestures</li><li>Being punctual for the interview, and responding to emails proactively</li></ul>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;<strong>3. Greet the Interviewer Decently:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>“First impression is the last impression.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your gesture before the interviewer makes a great impact in posing a good impression. While greeting the interviewer, you should shake hands confidently, use formal language, and maintain eye contact. The way you greet the recruiter can make a lasting impression.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Don&#8217;t Reflect that You are Here for the Salary:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>It is obvious that everyone aspires to get a good salary while switching jobs. But you should remember to not emphasise your salary expectations repeatedly during the interview, as it tends to make a not-so-good impression of you and can make the recruiter feel that you are here only for the salary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The recruiter should feel that you are more excited about the job role and company than the salary. You should also remember to not give a number and instead present your demanded salary range.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Pay Extra Attention to Communication Skills:&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>From introducing yourself to ending the interview, all that matters is how well you communicate throughout. Keep your tone polite and speak with good command of the language with jargon of the job profile. Many people have a good command of English but tend to not speak out properly when facing an interview. But do not worry. You can easily fix your speaking skills with these simple tips:</p>



<ul><li>Be well prepared and rehearse near the mirror to reduce your anxiety </li><li>Listen carefully first and then answer with a polite tone </li><li>Be concise and clear on what to say</li><li>Use confident body language</li></ul>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Exhibit a Balance of IQ and EQ:&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Answering the basic questions about your skills and experience is easy; but many times the recruiter may ask you emotional or tricky questions like- ‘Tell me about a time when you handled a tough situation?’ or ‘What success means to you?’ This is where you are likely to go blank and may not know what to answer spontaneously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These EQ and IQ-based questions are deliberately asked by the recruiter to judge your abilities and to know what kind of person you are, and if you can be the right fit for the job demands. They purposely want to check your mental and emotional ability to handle situations &amp; people. Therefore you need to keep a balance of both in order to prove yourself as the right fit for the job.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>7. Be Prepared to Talk About Your Future Goals:&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>It is very likely that the recruiter will ask you this question- ‘Where do you see yourself in the next 5 years?’ This is among the most frequently asked questions in interviews. The main motive for asking this question is that the recruiter wants to know about your future career goals and how ambitious you are to achieve those goals. </p>



<p>The appropriate way to answer this question is to keep your ambitions in line with the company’s vision &amp; growth. Just try to be specific about your career goals and show that you also want to stick with the hiring company for a long term. This will pose a good impression of you. Instead, if you answer that you want to start your own venture in the near future, you might be rejected.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>8. Dress Appropriately: </strong></h4>



<p>Dressing well in the interview is an important step in building a good impression. It is good if you try not to dress casually and wear formal and professional clothes which will indicate that you are serious about the interview. Here are a few tips to dress up nicely in the interview:</p>



<ul><li>Wear formal pants, dress or shirts in black, navy blue or grey colours</li><li>Keep your hair tied neatly and your nails trimmed. Present yourself so that you look clean</li><li>Wear limited or no jewellery or fancy things.</li><li>Wearing a watch shows that you’re an organised person.</li></ul>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;<strong>9. Accept a Glass of Water, Tea or Coffee:&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>It is likely that the recruiter may offer you some water, tea or a cup of coffee. You should never shy away from accepting what they offer. By doing so you get a short moment to calm yourself down, and the interviewer also feels like a good host, making the interview comfortable.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>10. Prepare Some Intelligent Questions to Ask the Interviewer:&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>At the end of the interview it is good if you try to ask some intelligent questions that you might be curious to know. After all, it&#8217;s not just about finding if you are the right fit for the company, it&#8217;s also important to know whether the company is right for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few questions that can be asked to the recruiter are:</p>



<ul><li>What are the next steps in the interview process?</li><li>What are the challenges in this job role?</li><li>Who will be there in your team, &amp; what is the hierarchy?</li></ul>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Dos and Don’ts in an Interview </strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th> <strong>Dos </strong> </th><th><strong>Don’ts</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Dress Professionally&nbsp;</td><td>Don’t Act too Casual&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Don’t be Late</td><td>Don’t Falsify Your Application/ Resume&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Be an Active Listener&nbsp;</td><td>Don’t Exhibit Frustration or Desperation&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Have Some Questions Prepared Beforehand</td><td>Keep Away from Your Phone and Other Devices&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Research About the Company Beforehand</td><td>Don’t Exhibit Bad Body Posture</td></tr><tr><td>Pay Extra Attention to Your Body Language</td><td>Don&#8217;t Make the Interviewer Guess Your Interests&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Takeaway </strong></h3>



<p>Presenting yourself as a confident &amp; right candidate for the job is highly imperative. As such, the 10 job interview etiquettes discussed above will undeniably help you sound very confident and a right fit for the job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is really appreciable that many reputed Institutes like <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/nmims-distance-mba/">NMIMS (NGA-SCE)</a> assist their students in preparing for the competitive job market.</p>

<p>Most Indian parents want their children to pursue a management degree due to the many perks it has to offer. But ever since globalisation has expanded its roots formal education has taken a back seat. Hence the students are in a dilemma whether to pursue a degree or not. Reports have also shown that a management degree is not a pre-requisite to land good jobs or higher positions in organisations. However, having an <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/distance-mba-financial-management/">MBA in Finance</a>, Banking or Marketing Management is always a bonus.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Skills that Formal Management Education Helps You Develop&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/nmims-executive-mba-wx-programs/">NMIMS’ executive MBA</a> is a 24-month course that is thoughtfully crafted and packed with skill-based knowledge. The university offers five specialisations in this course, namely: &#8211;&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Marketing</li><li>Digital Marketing</li><li>Applied Finance</li><li>Operations and Supply Chain</li><li>Leadership and Strategy</li></ol>



<p>Moreover, they have collaborated with Harvard Business School&nbsp; to provide an optional certificate course for value addition, thus, exposing students to the global education system.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is Executive MBA Better than MBA?</strong></h3>



<p>You must be wondering why an Executive MBA is better than an MBA. There are a lot of similarities in the course such as duration, application process, test requirements, etc. but EMBA has an edge because the individual already has 10 to 12 years of corporate experience so as to build something of his own.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>According to Caryn L. Beck-Dudley, the president and CEO of AACSB International, the enrollment in executive courses has increased to 68%.</em></strong> This degree is meant for working professionals who want to land leadership positions in organisations. It is an ideal way to give a push to your career if you are at a standstill.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Final Thoughts&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>We are sure you can come up with many reasons and examples saying a management degree is not necessary but we are saying that an MBA or an Executive MBA can help accelerate the process. You get to build a network, learn how theoretical knowledge can be executed to practical projects. Through the capstone projects and internships students learn how to work in a team which is imperative to build a business.&nbsp;</p>
