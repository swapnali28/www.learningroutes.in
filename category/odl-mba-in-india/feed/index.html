<p>From hand-written mails to ultra-modern AR classrooms, distance education has certainly come a long way. For this long and lasting journey, we give the entire credit (without any second thoughts) to the trailblazing technology and the quenchless thirst for knowledge. But more importantly, the trailblazing technology. Through the sophisticated yet simpler mediums of e-lectures, televisions, podcasts, and virtual classrooms, educational institutions deliver ODL courses to students located in the remotest corners at a cost much lower than the regular courses. Distance education lets a student juggle between work and study, all at the same time. So, next time, when you are stuck under a truckload of work and still wish to pursue an MBA without resigning, you are definitely not out of your head. Not at all. We assure you that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently,<a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/new-ugc-regulation-brings-online-distance-learning-at-par-with-conventional-education/"> the University Grants Commission (UGC) released a notification</a> that has brought Open and Distance Learning (ODL)  Learning at par with Regular Learning. Without an ounce of doubt, the notification has added to the credibility of the distance learning mode. Let us not forget that and also the fact that better job offers are awaiting us as soon as we update our resume with a Distance MBA.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why MBA?</strong></h3>



<p>No one can deny the fact that an MBA degree on a resume is a spectacular sight. Also, no one, absolutely no one can deny that a stellar MBA degree pays you much more than just a dream job with a rewarding salary. It equips you with a powerful combination of academic, professional, and personal development lessons.&nbsp;</p>
