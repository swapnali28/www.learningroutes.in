<p>According to Technavio, the pool of MBA graduates will see an increment of USD 2.28 billion between the years 2021 and 2025 in India. Over the last few years, online degrees have seen more acceptance due to various advantages that they bring along.</p>



<p>In the year 2021, Nirmala Sitharaman, Finance Minister of India announced that top universities and institutes listed under NIRF will offer online courses and this announcement led to a gateway of opportunities, especially for the working professionals. After this declaration by the finance minister, a huge wave of students enrolled in online courses and thus contributing to the economy and their careers.</p>



<div style="height:14px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the advantages of an online MBA?</strong></h3>



<p>As reported by Renub Research, the e-learning industry will observe a drastic increment by the year 2026. In numbers, the industry will be USD $8.6 billion large.</p>



<p>Universities are leveraging this industry and making big money out of it but it’s a win-win for both sides; students as well universities. Following are some advantages of online MBA courses: &#8211;</p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Acceptance</h4>



<p>The last few years have increased enrolment rates in online MBA courses and these numbers increased since March 2020 as soon as COVID-19 hit the economy. During that time, e-learning platforms saved the providence of India. As reported by News 18, Shafi Vikraman, a man from Thiruvananthapuram utilized his time effectively and completed 145 online certificate courses not only from India but from the Ivy League Universities. The man has set an example for all the people who lacked confidence in online courses.</p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Opportunity to multitask</h4>



<p>Universities like Narsee Monjee Institute of Management gives the opportunity to work and simultaneously do their online MBA course. There are many other universities that have the same criteria for example &#8211; Amity University, Chandigarh University, Dr, DY Patil University, etc.</p>



<p>Online MBA courses are thoughtfully crafted for the working professional so that they can execute their knowledge in their current job and as a long-term goal they can apply for better high-package jobs or get a promotion in their current company.</p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Online courses have more reach</h4>



<p>Online courses have more reach than regular courses. For regular courses, the students have to relocate to a specific location and look for suitable accommodation that proves to be heavy on the pocket. On the other hand, <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/nmims-distance-mba/">online MBA courses</a> can be opted from anywhere anytime. In addition, these online courses are industry-aligned and focus on helping students gain the most in-demand skills. Not to forget, the career advancement services and placements do come along as a major hallmark of the online courses.</p>



<p>Online courses are also not restricted to only high-scoring students because they offer opportunities to others and also value the work experience gained by them.</p>



<div style="height:14px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>ROI of online MBA</strong></h3>



<p>Despite the factors listed above and well known to all, there is still a lack of confidence in online MBA courses. Hence here are some facts and figures that will make you believe its importance.</p>



<p>The ROI of an online MBA degree can vary on various factors, such as: &#8211;</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Specialization</li><li>Graduating University</li><li>Placement and Networking assistance etc.</li></ol>



<p>The investment in online MBA colleges varies from where you do your course, for example &#8211; you have to invest 1.40 Lakh to take admission in Narsee Monjee Institute of Management but you have to invest INR 58,000 to take admission in IGNOU online MBA. But NMIMS also offers career assistance, interview preparation, and an Alumni portal for the students. Similarly, other universities have different USPs, and it should be an integral factor to look into while choosing a course. Although there are subjective factors that come into play for instance &#8211; interview, and exam which depends entirely on the student. Despite that Glassdoor has suggested that the average package of a beginner who opts for an online MBA degree can be approximately 3.60 Lakhs per annum.</p>



<p>Reports have also suggested that the salaries can also vary with specializations. According to Career 360, the average salary of a Sales Manager is INR 5.00 lakhs, a Brand Manager earns INR 9.00 lakhs on an average and a Marketing Manager has an earning potential of INR 6.50 lakhs. These are a few listed salaries but the opportunities after pursuing an online MBA are limitless.</p>



<p>Other aspects to take into consideration are placement opportunities and accreditations. Often, students tend to miss out on this information. If you are opting for an online course and your university is not accredited then your time, energy and investment can fall flat to their face.</p>



<p>World recognized brands and companies are keen to offer jobs to students who pursue their MBA via online mode because they also have previous work experience which helps the companies onboard new and fresh talent. Top recruiters of online MBA are &#8211; Microsoft, Google, Adobe, Infosys, Wipro, Amazon, Flipkart, Nestle, etc.</p>



<div style="height:14px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>University Recommendations</strong></h3>



<p>Most universities in India have initiated offering online and distance MBA courses. Among the top are: &#8211;</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Narsee Monjee Institute of Management</li><li>IMT Ghaziabad</li><li>Dr. DY Patil University</li><li>Chandigarh University</li><li>Amity University</li></ol>



<p>These universities are in popular demand among the students. They are also accredited by national and international bodies that prove their authority in the domain.</p>



<div style="height:14px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Online MBA: an Overview</strong></h3>



<p>According to Hayden Noel, a professor from Gies College of Business; “The training you receive in an MBA Program prepares you to deal with ambiguity and provides a buffer against uncertainty. You would be better equipped to take advantage of changing opportunities post-COVID. You will also become more effective as a leader and better understand the different functions of your organization.”</p>



<p>India is ranked 2nd for e-learning after the US. Students and hiring companies have also acknowledged these degrees. As much as regular courses are popular, in a certain way they cannot beat online courses because they require a huge investment of money and time. The only factor while choosing your online MBA courses should be a good and in-depth analysis of the university from where you will pursue your degree and their career assistance opportunities.</p>

<p>NMIMS is one of the top management institutes in the country.

<p>With coursework projects and assignments, you will develop interpersonal and problem-solving skills. Furthermore, working on tight deadlines will prepare you for the workplace environment.</p>



<p>A two-year program (MBA) that facilitates specialization in marketing, finance, and human resources management and the fact that the demand for an MBA (Marketing) has seen a steep increase in the past few years due to its huge career prospects.</p>



<p>Most importantly during an MBA course, a student gets exposure to what’s precisely happening and is demanded in the outside world. A student is given the opportunity to interact closely with industry experts who share their vast practical experience. In this regard, it is often seen that an industry expert also acts as a mentor for the students guiding them through the important frameworks of different sectors.</p>



<p>Now, when considering an MBA (or distance MBA) the question arises which are the best universities in India that have the most comprehensive and meticulous management programs. NMIMS University, without a doubt, comes to the top of our lists considering the fact that their business school is considered among top-tier institutes in India. Along with providing career advancement services, their syllabus and curriculum are aligned to help students develop skills in them.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Notably, and in detail, an NMIMS MBA India helps students in the following significant ways –</strong></h4>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Get a Competitive Advantage</strong></h5>



<p>Besides having technical knowledge, managerial skills are much more pertinent to growing in a career. The knowledge gained through a comprehensive degree program MBA places a candidate in a position to take strategic decisions and helps the organization to grow.</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Earn a Higher Salary</strong></h5>



<p>With the responsibility of taking strategic decisions, a higher salary is one of the perks that come with having an MBA. Thus, it is one of the right and important decisions to pursue an MBA.</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Leadership Role</strong></h5>



<p>Each individual aspires to take a leadership role at some stage of their career. However, a candidate with an MBA always stands a higher chance of being given such an assignment considering the fact that the degree brings analytical and various other essential skills.</p>



<p>There is a varied range of subjects that students get to study during the NMIMS Distance MBA in the marketing program. However, it is important to note that a student who has an MBA degree is preferred to be given a promotion as it’s a safe bet and understandably in the organization’s favor to give an opportunity to someone who has acquired managerial skills through academic pursuit.</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Career Advancement Opportunities</strong></h5>



<p>An MBA (Marketing) helps you get a job promotion and prepares you for management and executive positions.</p>



<p>This postgraduate program equips you with the required leadership and communication skills so you can grab the top marketing jobs with ease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The program of MBA (Marketing) mainly enhances your business development, advertising, and marketing skills. It also helps one’s interpersonal skills and get into the mind of the consumer.</p>



<p>These are some of the skills required for a senior-level position. Furthermore, with technological augmentation, marketing becomes the heart of any organization, creating an innovative marketing job profile mix.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Management programs are popularly known for helping individuals elevate their career paths. However, not everybody has the privilege to resign from their jobs and take up full-time management programs. In this regard, the question that so often arises in the minds of the people is, is an online/ distance MBA equivalent or as valued as an offline post-graduate management program. The answer to this is quite simple. In the current times, wherein norms are being redefined, the acceptability of an online and distance MBA is wide and overwhelming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having said that, once candidates are wholly convinced that online and distance MBA options are as good, they might feel that both are the same things/courses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hence, to begin with, an online MBA can be explained as an improvised and better version of a distance MBA. It can also be said that it is basically like the evolution of a distance MBA for even wider acceptability and better upskilling of students through an industry-aligned curriculum that facilitates interaction between students and teachers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, distance learning is individual-based learning. While this course gives you the freedom to join an MBA program anywhere in the world, candidates must handle most parts of the course on their own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The students enrolling in distance education programs in India are given the books and syllabus and then they are all on their own to learn and acquire knowledge and information. Incurably, a distance MBA is not much interaction-based. The study material is sent by post. Although the course materials are articulated and designed in a way that they can be easily comprehended, student dedication plays a critical role.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Institutes/Universities which offer distance learning usually have their centers in different cities. One goes to these exam centers and writes their final examination.</p>



<p>The centers established in varied cities are mostly established for administrative reasons but on rare occasions, the students are called a few times to interact with the experts. If a student is a disciplined self-learner, this course can be helpful to a certain extent. Since there is not much technology involved, it is quite pocket friendly. Nonetheless, the biggest concern is that many students get demotivated and get bored because of having to learn in their shells. This being one of the biggest limitations of the distance MBA programs, many would not want to take it up for lack of peer learning avenues, etc.</p>



<p>Now, moving to a wholesome discussion about what an online MBA is. It is mainly technology and internet-based learning of management subjects. The best online business schools from IIMs to XLRI, Narsee Monjee (NMIMS), and Symbiosis offer virtual classes where you can interact with the experts of the subject and also with your fellow students. Thus, this course not only appears to be interesting and interactive but also helps in building networks. This course is beneficial in terms of that it can be reached anytime/anywhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The curriculum is aligned with industry demand with the principal focus being on helping students acquire the most in-demand market skills. Thus, it offers complete freedom. Hard copies of the course contents are provided by the online schools but there is no need to wait for them. The books and course material can be downloaded on the machine. Virtual classes also allow discussion, skills practice, lecture, or project discussions. This eliminates the chances of getting bored or demotivated.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Henceforward, we are attaching a tabular differentiation, particularly between an MBA that can be done through online Mode and Distance MBA in India.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Basis</td><td>Online MBA</td><td>Distance MBA</td></tr><tr><td>Accessibility</td><td>Access to PC and Internet is important to get through the course of the program</td><td>Study material is delivered at the address of the candidate.</td></tr><tr><td>Eligibility</td><td>Bachelor’s degree with a minimum score of 50%</td><td>Graduation from a recognized university</td></tr><tr><td>Attendance Requirement</td><td>Required as per the case</td><td>Not required</td></tr><tr><td>Student Teacher Interaction</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Assignments</td><td>To be submitted through online mode.</td><td>To be completed and submitted to the respective study centers</td></tr><tr><td>Placement Assistance</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Alumni Status</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Average Package</td><td>8.25 lacs approximately</td><td>6.50 lacs approximately</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Most importantly, an MBA that is done through online mode helps the students interact with each other and also learn under the guidance of an industry expert. Furthermore, unlike a distance MBA, the former brings students newer job opportunities in terms of placements, etc. NMIMS – one of the most renowned business schools in India is gaining mass popularity for its quality online management (MBA to be precise) programs which are widely being taken up by working professionals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With all said and done, the primary focus of candidates who are exploring management programs to elevate their careers must consider their core requirements to choosing between the various modes of management programs. Of course, if they feel that peer learning and having an expert for more insights and meticulous knowledge is important to them, an MBA via online mode should be their go-to option. But in case the candidate feels that technology isn’t the right medium for that and they can individually learn better at their pace, a distance MBA can well be a good option for them.</p>



<p>Now all you need to do is to understand your requirements. Also, check out the availability of the technology for yourself and then get enrolled in either distance MBA or MBA via online mode.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><u>Frequently Asked Questions</u></strong></h4>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Does MBA Distance and Online get placements via institute?</strong></h5>

<p>Yes, they are as valued as a regular MBA. But of course, things depend on the skills and potentially a candidate has been able to acquire.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the top colleges offering MBAs through online mode?</strong></h5>



<p>Some of the top colleges that offer the program are IIMs, XLRI, Narsee Monjee, Symbiosis, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This article shortlists a few universities and specialized courses that are perfect for working professionals.

<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Annamalai University&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/anna.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-9431"/><figcaption><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Annamalai University&nbsp;</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>S. R. M. Annamalai Chettiar created Annamalai University, which combines Sri Minakshi College, Sri Minakshi Tamil College, and Sri Minakshi Sanskrit College. According to the Annamalai University Act 1928, a &#8220;University&#8221; was founded on January 1, 1929, by combining the three institutions. In 2021, Annamalai University is granted the status of affiliating university, and colleges in Villupuram, Cuddalore, Kallakurichi, and Mayiladuthurai are affiliated with the university. Annamalai Institution is the country&#8217;s largest public residential university, obtaining an &#8216;A&#8217; rating from NAAC in 2014.</p>



<p>Annamalai University is not only well known in India but has also collaborated with foreign universities in various countries such as &#8211; the United States, Europe, Australia, and Japan.

<p>Annamalai University offers 8 specializations in their distance MBA courses, Marketing Management, International Business, Hotel Management, and Catering to name a few courses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are a few universities that are the priority choices of students. There are, indeed, other universities that may meet these criteria such as Amity University, SP Jain Institute of management, etc. The selection of the university is also a subjective choice of the students which is fair enough but we recommend you to do your due diligence and consider the 5 parameters that are discussed above.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides the aforementioned institutes offering some of the best part-time or distance MBA courses, there are other institutes that a student can look forward to based on their individual research. However, if particularly a student is looking for a distance MBA in India or distance MBA in the country, we strongly recommend factors like career advancement services, mentorship, and placement assistance when choosing an distance management program.</p>
