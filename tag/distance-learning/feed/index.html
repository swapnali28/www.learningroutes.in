										<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Wisely chosen goals and job profiles can help you attain financial freedom. You must figure out what are the things that you must do to make yourself suitable for the role that you wish to pursue. For instance, you may think that you require a professional degree such as MBA in order to give yourself and your career a margin over others.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Distance learning is a form of learning in which students and teachers are not present in the same place or time but use different means of communication to facilitate the teaching-learning process. Distance education began through the <strong>use of postcards by Isaac Pitman in 1840. However, today the sector has evolved a lot and employs a variety of media such as video chat, computer internet, print, film, television, and other modes of communication. </strong>By now, it must be clear that distance education is designed to focus on pedagogy and andragogy in education to students without any physical presence. Let us explore more about it. Here are some amazing distance learning facts that most people don&#8217;t know about.</p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>1. The <strong>University of London</strong> was the first to launch a distance learning course in the year 1858. This is said to be the formal initiation of distance learning. </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>2. Distance learning in the true sense was first started by <strong>Sir Isaac Pitman in the 1840s</strong> wherein he used to send postcards to students. He taught a system of stenography by mailing stenographically transcribed texts on postcards and receiving transcripts from students in exchange for proofreading. </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>3. The first correspondence school in the <strong>United States</strong> was<strong> founded in 1873</strong>. It was named the “Society to Encourage Studies at Home.” The institute was directed towards promoting education among women. It encouraged women to devote some part of every day to study. </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>4. Studies at home was founded and encouraged by <strong>Anna Eliot Ticknor</strong> with the aim to empower women of America who are already busy with their household chores and cannot devote their time and are not able to attend classes in regular mode. </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>5. <strong>Wolsey Hall, Oxford</strong> is the first distance learning college in the UK which was founded in  1894. </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>6. Wolsey Hall, Oxford is the <strong>largest homeschooling college</strong> in the world which offers various courses in Primary, Secondary, IGCSE, and many other A-level subjects. It offers distance education to more than <strong>120 different countries</strong>.</p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>7. Distance learning is a <a href="https://www.indiacollegeshub.com/distance-education-in-india.aspx">relatively new concept in India</a>. It has been around in the UK since 1858. However, in India, it only dates back to the early 1960s.</p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>8. In the year <strong>1961, in India, the Central Advisory Board for Education</strong> established a committee <strong>chaired by Dr. D. S. Kothari</strong> to make important suggestions regarding the nature, scope, and structure of distance learning courses.</p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>9. In India, the first <strong>Distance Education Center</strong> was established in 1962 by the <strong>University of Delhi. </strong>It was later renamed as the School of Correspondence Course and Continuing Education. </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>10. <a href="https://deb.ugc.ac.in/DEB/LearningTrends"><strong>The University Grants Commission took over</strong> the Distance Education Council</a> in <strong>2013 </strong>and established the Distance Education Authority to oversee future distance education in India. </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>11. According to <strong>AISHE reports</strong> (2017-18), <strong>distance enrollment accounts for 11% </strong>of total higher education enrollment. Most students and working professionals opt for distance education.  </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>12. By <strong>2027</strong>, <strong>e-learning is expected to reach well over $1 trillion</strong>. It is a 21% increase from the $250 billion surpassed in 2020. </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>13. <strong>E-learning</strong> is more engaging than traditional instructor-led training sessions and <a href="https://elearningindustry.com/elearning-is-essential-not-overrated-5-key-reasons"><strong>can improve knowledge retention by up to 60%</strong>.</a> With the comfort of home, students can stay focused without getting distracted. </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>14. If we look at employee skill development programmes, it has been found that e-learning takes 40-60% less time per employee as compared to traditional instructor-led training. </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>15. 40% of companies say that e-learning has helped them attain a higher revenue, and companies that offer e-learning have seen a 25% or more increase in revenue per employee. This is because e-learning is more affordable than other means of learning and there is no need to set up heavy infrastructural facilities which helps companies to cut extra expenses. </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>16. The enterprise e-learning market is expected to <strong>grow to USD 38.09 billion between 2020 and 2024.</strong></p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>17. 25% of Indian students are enrolled in at least one distance learning course.</p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>18. <strong>In the year 2020, the mobile e-learning industry grew by $38 billion.</strong> This upward trend is expected to continue and reach to <strong>$6 billion by 2022.</strong> To streamline the process of distance learning, more and more universities and institutes are moving toward mobile apps so as to offer students more accessibility. </p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>19. Developed by <strong>MIT and Harvard, EdX</strong> is an example of a massive open-source online course. The platform has over 20 million users and over 70 million signups.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>Bonus Point:&nbsp;</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Studies have shown that the <strong>employability rate for MBA students is 55.09% in the year 2022</strong>. Gone are the days when only a minor section of people used to opt for an MBA degree. That too just for the sake of getting a degree. Nowadays, students opt for this course because it is highly lucrative. Over the past few decades, the demand for an MBA degree has increased manifold, especially among working professionals. With the introduction of open and distance learning mode more and more students are taking advantage of it to study further. This helps them to explore more career options while also utilising their spare time.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is Distance Education Valid in India?</strong></h3>



<p>On September 2, 2022, the UGC released a notification saying that Open and Distance Learning Courses are now at par with regular courses. The main objective of this move was to promote distance education and increase the literacy rate in the country.&nbsp; As per the notice:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/sbqUNCmg2x6Gwt9CBP0Q23HTUDY4OE0JUUtE8HBcdBzfcoABFvbXszpG5Ui1_g7ipk-1fwKFdSyuUOL_kKr8AYL_OO4hQThHwybmGgNlg1CjQ5ck_-a8kywJZWjzJx9_ehPKxBhMTxJel7-s7a13Wl1gzTLztERDv0C7YR0QgqcsfLKsggQ13MmBlpQ9Lg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Another regulation that you should look out for is the one released by UGC-DEB. According to the guidelines, no university is allowed to deliver technical courses such as BE and B.Tech in distance mode. Therefore, opting for courses like MBA, MCA and other humanities courses is more beneficial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are considering choosing a course in ODL mode, first, do consider the accreditations of the universities. Second, compare what the university is deliversing and what India’s official statutory bodies have given permission to. Also, understand the gap between the two.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Distance MBA vs Regular MBA</strong></h3>



<p>According to surveys, <strong>in the academic year 2019-20, 51.8% students took at least one distance course</strong>. Ever since, there has been an increase in the enrollment rate of distance courses. However, there is also a long-standing debate on whether one should opt for distance courses or regular courses. Let us weigh the pros and cons of each mode of education.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pros and Cons of Distance Education</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Distance Education&nbsp;</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pros&nbsp;</strong></td><td><strong>Cons</strong></td></tr><tr><td>More Flexible&nbsp;</td><td>Lask of Individual Feedback</td></tr><tr><td>Work along with Learning</td><td>Too Much Study Material</td></tr><tr><td>No Age Bar</td><td>Less Physical Interaction with Peers&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>No Geographical Boundaries</td><td>Difficult to Prove the Credibility of the Courses</td></tr><tr><td>Low Cost</td><td>Preferred by Self-Motivated Students</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pros and Cons of Regular Courses&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Regular Courses</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pros</strong></td><td><strong>Cons</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Good Social Interaction</td><td>Expensive&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Campus Placement Opportunities</td><td>Requires Time Devotion&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Access to Labs and Other Resources</td><td>Not Feasible for Working Professionals&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>More Course Opportunities</td><td>Strict Schedule&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Immediate Feedback</td><td>Age Restrictions&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Now that we have explored the pros and cons of each mode of learning, let us also take a look at the differences between distance learning and classroom education.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Distance MBA</strong></td><td><strong>Regular MBA</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Who is it for</strong><br></td><td>Working/ Experienced Professionals&nbsp;</td><td>Students&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Duration</strong></td><td>Minimum 2 Years&nbsp;</td><td>2 Years Full Time Course</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fees Structure</strong></td><td>Comparatively Less Fee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>High Fee</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Curriculum</strong></td><td>It focuses on individual leadership development</td><td>It focuses on career development and organisational behaviour</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Future After Distance MBA</strong></h3>



<p>One of the common misconceptions about the Open and Distance Learning is that you do not get any career opportunities while pursuing the course. However, there are many universities, such as Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies, that offer placement opportunities to the students enrolled in their distance MBA courses. NMIMS also extends access to Career Development Services and free Alumni Portal. This helps students to network with prominent recruiters, alumni of the university and industry experts. Therefore, it will not be wrong to say that distance MBA opens multiple avenues for the students. Not just that but it also helps in getting promotions, accepting managerial positions or switching jobs to better opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Future after Regular MBA</strong></h3>



<p>Regular MBA or traditional MBA is the most relied upon option for management education. Studies report that <strong>India has the second largest pool of MBA graduates</strong>. If the enrollment rate continues to grow at the same speed, then it is expected that India will be ranked at the top. It is beyond doubt that MBA is among the most sought-after courses in the country. It caters to soft skills &amp; industry-oriented skills and deals with real-time project experience. Additionally, most universities in India offer internship opportunities, project work, capstone projects and much more for the students to gain industry experience. This helps the students to bridge the gap between corporate and college, thus making them job-ready.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>Irrespective of the mode of education, an MBA degree is highly lucrative and a valuable addition into your CV. Both the distance and the regular degrees hold the same value. An MBA course focuses on the following aspects:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Enhances Knowledge and Develops Advanced Business Skills</li><li>Job Security&nbsp;</li><li>More Job Opportunities&nbsp;</li><li>Entrepreneurial Mindset&nbsp;</li><li>High Salaries&nbsp;</li><li>Career Shift&nbsp;</li><li>Soft Skill Development</li></ul>



<p>Whether it is a distance course or a regular course, both focus on these characteristics. You will get to develop on a personal as well as a professional level while pursuing the course.&nbsp; Therefore, you must go for the mode of education that suits your needs and your pocket. We have busted some distance education myths for you so that you can focus on what really matters while making your choice. If you don’t want to put your career on hold, then distance MBA is the way to go.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>India has the largest population of young individuals under the demographic age of 5 to 24, which makes the future of the Indian education industry bright and colorful. According to IBEF, the education sector in India was&nbsp; valued atUS $117 billion in the year 2020 and is forecasted to reach approximately US $225 billion in 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The Indian Edtech market size is expected to reach US$ 30 billion by 2031. </strong>The credit for the same goes not only to traditional mode of studies but also to skill-based open &amp; distance learning courses. <strong>According to KPMG, India has the second largest e-education sector after the US.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The Indian Government has taken various initiatives to empower and inculcate practicality. Focused upon skill-based learning, the government has been taking several initiatives to increase the enrollment rate by 30% in 2020 by means of campaigns like “Skill India” and “Digital India.”&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why is Skill-Based ODL Education Important?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>According to the recent UGC regulation, ODL courses are now at par with other modes of education because they provide students with the best of both worlds. Most universities offer distance courses night classes or weekend classes. This mode can also be called a hybrid mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ODL courses are specially designed while keeping working professionals in mind so that they can continue their job or business while upskilling on the side. In this mode, the students can interact with the teachers for doubts or exam queries and also with their fellow mates in an offline setting. However, they can also avail the option of self-paced learning.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/y3i6mMRzojvxgNr4Gq4ze0d8r-npVQvRUXUHYTKSYPXlAHargqBto1_ka7onYMruTdbLkmu6e5mlo1igVsNhI3DmB6rX0rVr_t0OgmEXfu4SJkJtr0PSoID6f4PAJl8_npICpAatxSTz8Wf2cGgK19oHDNYeb8X55ekx9kHXeuZb_eZ0O4Jv76L0j2qy" alt=""/></figure>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pre-Requisites for Choosing an ODL course</strong></h3>



<p>The trick to leveraging ODL courses is to keep a few critical pre-requisites in mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first and foremost thing to keep in mind is choosing an institute. This decision can make or break your career. The integral component while considering your institute should be</p>



<ol><li>Course Specializations</li><li>Tuition Fee</li><li>Accreditations</li><li>Networking Opportunities&nbsp;</li><li>Placement Assistance&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Another thing you should consider while opting for a distance course is the institute&#8217;s location. It is impractical to opt for a course from a university that is far away from your location because that will affect the time, lifestyle, and transportation cost you wanted to avoid with a full-time course.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Should You Choose an ODL Course?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Since we have discovered the scope of part-time courses and established the pre-requisites that should be taken care of, it is time to validate the fact and understand why you should opt for this mode of education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the most significant advantages of ODL mode of learning is the ability to balance your studies with your work or family obligations. Distance education allows you the freedom to combine the two aspects of your life, as well as the financial benefits of being able to continue working while still funding your studies.</p>



<p>Some added benefits are &#8211;&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. If you are already in a job, then ODL courses can help you get a promotion&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. It can help you expand your job options</p>



<p>3. You can make a transition to your job in a field that you want to work in</p>



<p>4. You can cut down the transportation cost, living expenses, and miscellaneous costs&nbsp;</p>



<p>5. While pursuing a degree, you can obtain professional credentials while working</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Which Universities in India offer ODL Courses?</strong></h3>



<p>Distance education is in vogue lately and many, many universities are trying to incorporate this mode of education. While the process is still going on, some universities have successfully done it and are setting an example.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To list a few of them: &#8211;&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>NMIMS NGASCE</li><li>Symbiosis Centre For Distance Learning Institute</li><li>Sikkim Manipal University</li><li>Amity University</li><li>Jawaharlal Nehru University</li><li>Chandigarh University</li></ol>



<p>And the list goes on.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Name of University Offering&nbsp; Distance Education&nbsp;</strong></td><td><strong>Course</strong></td><td><strong>Fee Structure (Per Year)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>NMIMS&nbsp;</td><td>MBA</td><td>1,68,000</td></tr><tr><td>SCDL</td><td>BCA</td><td>54,000&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>UPES</td><td>MBA</td><td>1,50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Chandigarh University</td><td>BCom</td><td>12,850</td></tr><tr><td>Jaipur National University</td><td>BBA</td><td>14,000</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Job Opportunities for Students Who Choose ODL Courses?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Is an ODL Degree of any use? Do students get the same packages as those who are full-time students? Are there any globally recognised universities in India that offer distance courses?&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are some of the questions that immediately popped up when we talked about the distance mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, the answer is, “Yes, you can find all the opportunities.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though the idea of ODL courses is not that popular, the job opportunities are not limited. A student who has opted for such a course will get the equal and same type of opportunities as a full-time student.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recruiters now understand that skills and experience are more important than the mode of education.<strong> </strong>Since there is no effect on opportunities, there is also no effect on the packages, and there is an extra advantage that your working hours will be less.&nbsp;<br>The only difference in case of opting for an ODL course is that the eligibility may vary. Apart from a specific education qualification, the universities may ask for some work experience.<br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has transformed the world in more than one way. We all have borne the brunt of it. The pandemic has particularly transmuted the education system in India. Online &amp; Distance Learning (ODL) came to the rescue at a time when life had come to a halt. Since then it has considerably replaced the regular mode of learning and continues to do so even today. To encourage more enrollments in the ODL mode of learning, the <a href="https://www.ugc.ac.in/pdfnews/8526483_ODL-Online-degree-through-conventional-mode.pdf">UGC recently released a notification</a> wherein it has placed Online Learning, Open and Distance Learning (ODL), and Regular Learning on the same pedestal.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The New UGC Regulation</strong></h3>



<p>The said notification in question was released by the UGC on September 2, 2022. It says that all the undergraduate, postgraduate, and postgraduate diploma programs which are being offered Online Learning and Open and Distance Learning (ODL), will now enjoy the same status as the courses being run in the regular mode. This move was made to accelerate the development of Online Learning and Open and Distance Learning (ODL) in the realm of Indian education.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OKia9xOESMAiBK8GBH2HFRJOXHawtcp6sDO_m6TQsoWWBa7d5DnJZNcdEaQXc1HkMgtpt19rezGNg7-keq9mMpI6AkkiAlgPe_rcW-VwugHHUmZJ7o6Qh8VxRZpsWzJnqvsjXBZygcl2dKGYrT35i1y67tjVKNCRzNXPPj5QxypBfYYi0uAtPczWgA" alt=""/></figure>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Regular Learning vs. Open and Distance Learning (ODL) vs. Online Learning</strong></h3>



<p>To develop a better understanding about the three modes of education that are being offered in the country, let us first look at their features individually. If we talk about the regular mode of learning, the teaching-learning process takes place in a conventional classroom set-up. However, the same is not the case when it comes to Online Learning as well as Open and Distance learning (ODL). In case of ODL mode, the teachers and the students meet only occasionally at the respective learning centres. This absence of a regular teacher-student interaction is compensated by providing self-learning material to students which is often sent through mail or post. Therefore, the students are solely responsible for their learning. Examinations for Open and Distance Learning (ODL) courses are conducted at the various regional centres set-up by the university.</p>



<p>Moving on to Online learning, it has revolutionised the entire educational domain. It is very different from both regular mode of learning as well as Open and Distance Learning (ODL). Here, teachers and students interact using a technologically advanced infrastructure. The lessons are delivered online using various Learning Management Software. Lectures are delivered either Live or in the form of recorded classes. The information is supplemented by online accessible resources. Examination for online learning is conducted from anywhere through internet-enabled equipment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The table given below presents the comparison between Regular Learning, Online Learning, and Open and Distance Learning (ODL):</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Criteria</strong></td><td><strong>Regular Learning</strong></td><td><strong>Online Learning</strong></td><td><strong>Open and Distance Learning (ODL)</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Student-Teacher Interaction</strong></td><td>In-person interaction</td><td>Frequent interaction via virtual platforms</td><td>Rare Student-Teacher Interaction</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Class Schedule</strong></td><td>Fixed Class Timings</td><td>Flexible Class Timings</td><td>Rarely Scheduled</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Examination Schedule and Assignment Submissions</strong></td><td>Rigid Schedule</td><td>Flexible Schedule</td><td>Rigid Schedule</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pedagogy</strong></td><td>Interactive, Blended (Traditional+Modern) Pedagogy</td><td>Interactive, Blended (Traditional+Modern) Pedagogy</td><td>Less interactive</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Networking</strong></td><td>Wide, Professional Networking</td><td>Wide, Professional Networking</td><td>Low Opportunity of Networking</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Attributes of the UGC Notification</strong></h3>



<p>The current UGC decision to equate the modes of Online Learning and Open and Distance Learning (ODL) with the regular learning mode will boost admission in the former modes of education. It will particularly benefit the working professionals, who want to upskill but are loaded with a heavy schedule. The flexibility inherent in the Online learning mode and the Open Distance Learning (ODL) mode facilitates them to efficiently manage both.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As all the mediums are now put at an equal footing, the UGC enables a student to switch to another mode, if and only if the courses and the higher educational institutions follow the set guidelines. This provides freedom to the students and the working professionals to structure their career paths.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a student has already taken admission to a course through the said mediums in the higher educational institutions, that were recognised during the time of admission, but their recognition was later repealed, the current UGC notification will apply to such admission if the UGC norms are properly complied with&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Things to Consider about UGC Rules and Regulations 2022</strong></h3>



<p>The UGC circulated a cautionary notice three weeks back regarding the <a href="https://www.ugc.ac.in/pdfnews/3409840_Public-Notice-DEB.pdf">UGC Rules and Regulations 2022</a>. The notice educates the students, who wish to enrol themselves in Online learning and Open and Distance Learning (ODL) courses.</p>



<p>As mentioned earlier, the UGC has recognised only those higher education institutions for the medium of Online learning and Open and Distance Learning&nbsp; (ODL), that meet its conditions. In its previous notice, the UGC asked students to look out for such information, when choosing a higher educational institution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, to impart holistic education, inclusive of the non-theoretical curriculum (if any), the UGC forbids some courses to be imparted through the Online Learning mode and Open and Distance Learning&nbsp; (ODL) mode. These courses, like Engineering, Physiotherapy, Medical, Architecture, Hotel Management, etc, have indispensable practical courses, to which the Online Learning and Open and Distance Learning (ODL) mediums can’t do justice. Also, M. Phil. and Ph. D. Programmes are forbidden for said modes. Therefore, the students, who wish to take admissions in these courses, can’t do so through the said modes of learning.</p>



<p>The following are the listed Programmes that are forbidden for Online learning and Open and Distance Learning (ODL):</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Takeaway</strong></h3>



<p>In the post-pandemic era, where we are still recovering from the repercussions of the COVID, the current UGC decision brings respite to the plights of the students, for whom education had become a huge concern. It’s a huge step forward in the direction of acclimatisation to the changing needs of the Indian educational arena.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
