<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Global Recession 2023</strong></h3>



<p>According to the leading economic research organisations, the world is going to face a global recession by the year 2023. The upcoming uncertainty around the global recession makes one wonder about the jobs that will stay unaffected by it. Young people entering the workforce are using their resources to develop recession-proof skills to shine in their respective careers. There are various sectors that do not get affected by the recession. The growth rate in these sectors does not decrease. Some of the sectors that will remain unaffected by the global recession 2023 are:-&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Medical and Healthcare</strong></h4>



<p>Our physical and mental healthcare does not care about what is going on with the economy. It is certain that in a global recession, the healthcare industry does not get affected. For instance, in times like COVID Pandemic &#8211; healthcare and wellbeing industry benefited the most while the other industries lagged behind. This industry offers the maximum job security to the workforce. In India, this industry contributes 5% to the GDP and is expected to rise at 22.87% in the following years.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Education&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>The education industry is one such industry that stays intact no matter how much the economy is affected. The education sector experiences a boost as many people return to schools and colleges to continue their education. Nowadays, open and distance learning has also emerged drastically. By 2025, the distance education industry is expected to rise by 2.28 Billion USD.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Public Utility</strong></h4>



<p>Workers in the utility sector enjoy a certain amount of job security even in the time of recession. The utility sector consists of electricity, water, internet services and waste management and these services are still required by the people even when the economy is in recession.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. <strong>Credit and Debt Management Counsellors</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Credit and Debt management becomes important especially during recession.&nbsp; People consult counsellors for smart management of their finances. Services of management counsellors are in great demand during the time of global recession.&nbsp; The industry can experience considerable growth during the period of global economic stagnation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. <strong>Consumer Packaged Goods Services&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>The consumer and packaged goods industry is the staple of any consumer. Especially the consumers that are young in age as they tend to become more reliant on packaged goods. The packaged goods are usually staple items and people will buy these goods and items even at the time of economic slowdown. This is usually the reason why this sector is not bound to really face the repercussions of the global recession. People working in this industry will not be influenced by recession. In Fact, in the year 2020, that too during the pandemic, the industry experienced a growth rate from 108.1% to 108.8%.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The IT Industry and the Global Recession&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>In the year 2020-21, the IT industry saw an exponential growth of 12%. According to the World Bank, 2023 will witness an increase in global inflation rate by 5%. As the world will be facing the global economic slowdown in 2023, the jobs in the IT sector are considered to be least affected by the recession. The reason for believing such an effect on the IT industry is the recent drop in the attrition of the Indian softtech-giant Infosys by 27.1%. Due to our increasing reliance on digital means for daily functions, the IT industry is experiencing a boom holistically. The big IT firms like Infosys, TCS and Wipro have bagged great deals with international enterprises. According to Kotak Institutional Equities, ‘<em> Tech spending continues to be a vital area of focus as banks and financial services firms are in the early stages or in the midst of a tech upgrade journey.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The growth in the Information Technology sector can be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic as most of the workspaces went digital. The IT industry saw a boom in the years 2020 and 2021. The pandemic compelled people to develop recession-proof skills like communication, Remote Project Management and flexibility. It was believed that after the pandemic, our reliance on IT services will decrease, however, the recent statistics point to the opposite. According to the Bureau of Labour Statistics, tech-related jobs are all set to grow in the next decade. Within the IT industry, there are certain job profiles that are considered to be recession-proof as well as highly rewarding at the times of global recession.&nbsp;</p>
