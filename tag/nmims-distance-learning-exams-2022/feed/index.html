<p>Exams are the most important element of your course. Therefore, it becomes important to understand the unique examination structure, rules &amp; regulations, and evaluation pattern of an institute. When it comes to regular colleges, you have your professors, classmates, and seniors to guide you through the Dos and Don’ts of examination. However, in case of distance learning examinations, most of the time, you don’t have anybody to guide you through the examination structure. In this blog, we will talk about the Dos and Don’ts of NMIMS Distance Learning Exams 2022.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exam Mode</strong></h3>



<p>To get a better understanding of NMIMS Distance Learning examinations, let us first walk through the pattern of exams. Currently, Narsee Monjee Institute conducts online exams through its student portal, Mettl. It is important to note here that NMIMS distance learning exams are remotely proctored. This means that an invigilator is always closely monitoring you while attempting the exams and it is mandatory for you to keep your camera and microphone on.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>System Compatibility</strong></h3>



<p>Before exams, you must check the system&#8217;s compatibility. You can do so by visiting their student portal. If you face any compatibility issues, you can address them by sending an email to Mettl, also sending a copy to NMIMS. You need to make sure that you use the same system for exams that you used for the compatibility and demo test. A demo test is yet another prerequisite for appearing in exams. You need to take a demo test every week and also 24 hours before the exam.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Internet Connectivity</strong></h3>



<p>After the compatibility test, the next important step is to make sure that you have a stable internet connection having a concurrent speed of not less than 512kbps. So, please avoid using a mobile hotspot as it can hamper connectivity. It is important to note here that in case, due to any reason you lose your internet connection during the exam, DO NOT close the browser. Your exam will resume as soon as you get internet connectivity.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Web Browser</strong></h3>



<p>Another important aspect of online examination is the web browser that you would be using. It is advisable to use only the latest version of Chrome or Firefox for a smooth examination experience.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do Not Use Remote Access Software</strong></h3>



<p>As per the Narsee Monjee exam guidelines, you need to make sure that there is no remote access software running on your system before or at the time of the exam. In case there is an active remote access software on your computer, their student portal will detect the same and will automatically close the examination browser. This not only means that your examination will get interrupted but can also lead to a UFM case.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Empty Room</strong></h3>



<p>In order to maintain decorum and the sanctity of the examination, you need to make sure that no one else is present around you, in the room, during the time of the exam. This rule is in place to ensure that there is not any kind of disturbance in the room. Your proctor can ask you to show your surroundings by rotating your laptop or webcam to provide them with a 360-degree view of the room at any point during the exam.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Not an Open Book Exam</strong></h3>



<p>A common misconception that most students have in the case of online exams is that they think that every online examination is an open-book exam. While there are many universities that are conducting open book exams since the pandemic, however, it is imperative to note here that not every institute is doing it. For instance, in the case of Narsee Monjee, you are not allowed to open your books while attempting the exam.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>No Browsing Allowed</strong></h3>



<p>A very important point to note while attempting the NMIMS distance learning exam 2022 is that you are not allowed to browse/ switch to any other window or application on their computer during the exam. Furthermore, you are not permitted to connect your computer to any extended screen or a projector.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>No Gadgets Allowed</strong></h3>



<p>Just like offline exams, during the NMIMS online exams, gadgets are strictly prohibited. You are not allowed to use mobile phones, tablets or any other electronic devices. Make sure that there are no gadgets around you at the time of the exam. In case you are facing any technical error, the same shall be conveyed to the Mettl support line via call.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>No Calculators Allowed</strong></h3>



<p>Narsee Monjee institute provides you with scientific calculators on the exam browser itself. Therefore, you are not allowed to use any physical calculator. It is advisable to not have any calculator near you as the same may be considered as a violation of the exam norms.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>No Breaks Allowed</strong></h3>



<p>Another important point to note here is that according to the NMIMS distance learning exam guidelines, no student is allowed to leave the room during an exam. This implies that you cannot take any break, not even for using the restroom. So, make sure that you avoid taking any breaks while attempting the exam.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Dos&nbsp;</strong></td><td><strong>Don’ts</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Check System Compatibility</td><td>Don’t Browse Through Other Applications While Giving Exam</td></tr><tr><td>Ensure Good Internet Connectivity</td><td>Don’t Take Breaks Between Exam</td></tr><tr><td>Ensure that Your Room is Empty</td><td>Don’t Keep Calculator or any Other Electronic Devices Near You</td></tr><tr><td>Take Demo Exam Well Before the Actual Exam</td><td>Do Not Use Remote Access Software</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exam Link</strong></h3>



<p>In order to avoid any last-minute discrepancies, NMIMS makes the various exam links available on their student portal subject-wise, 2 to 3 days in advance. However, the link will not get activated till the time of the actual examination. Therefore, please do not worry in case you try to open the link before the allocated time slot and it doesn’t work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Demo Exam</strong></h3>



<p>Please note that the Demo exam will be available over the Student portal in advance. You can take the demo exam to get familiar with the exam interface. You can navigate through different screens and check various options available for answering subjective-type questions.&nbsp; The demo exam will help in avoiding any major confusion on the day of the exam.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Evaluation Pattern of NMIMS</strong></h3>



<p>Narsee Monjee Institute follows a unique and well-planned evaluation system to assess a student’s performance during the exams. It follows a 70+30 pattern for assessment. Out of this, 70 percent weightage is given to exams, and the rest 30 percent is calculated by assignments. In the exam, there are two types of questions, that is MCQs and subjective-type. MCQs constitute 50 marks whereas theoretical questions make up for the remaining 20 marks.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>NMIMS has a well-planned policy for conducting distance learning exams. You need to keep in mind to follow all the rules and regulations set by the university. In case you are found not to be adhering to the standard procedure, the institute will take appropriate action for the same.</p>
