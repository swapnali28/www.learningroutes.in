<p>Enrolling in an MBA programme in Supply Chain Management helps you acquire all the essential business competencies required to effectively evaluate, oversee, and enhance the performance of supply chains across various organisations.</p>



<p>This sought-after MBA programme also equips you with the proficiency to comprehend and evaluate the interdependence among the vital functional units of a company and the external entities that contribute to the development, manufacturing, and delivery of products.</p>



<p>The curriculum primarily focuses on imparting fundamental knowledge about transportation, logistics, and distribution management in supply chain operations, which apply to both private and public sectors.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Supply Chain Management?</h2>



<p>Supply Chain Management involves managing goods from their raw material stage to their final product stage. This process encompasses everything up until the delivery of the final product to the customer. To optimise their organisation&#8217;s supply chain, professionals in this field use various techniques such as forecasting, enhancing inventory and transportation efficiency, cost reduction, understanding the flow of goods, and aligning supply chain networks.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Pursue Supply Chain Management?</h2>



<p>Regardless of their product range &#8211; cars, toys, aeroplane parts, t-shirts or toothpaste-all manufacturers rely on a supply chain to function. Effective management of supply chains can result in increased efficiency, reduced costs, improved management of supply and demand, and ultimately higher profits.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Supply Chain Management is a rapidly expanding field with a promising future.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">• Increased Scope</h3>



<p>The supply chain encompasses all aspects of a product&#8217;s life cycle, including acquisition, distribution, allocation, and delivery. The scope of this field is expanding rapidly due to technological advancements such as Blockchain and Cloud Computing.</p>



<p>As a Supply Chain Professional, your organisation will rely on you to predict market trends, ensure proper staffing, ensure timely delivery of parts, and react swiftly to unexpected issues. You will be an expert in prioritisation and can efficiently execute tasks, ultimately enabling others to perform their roles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The satisfaction that comes from being a driving force behind a team&#8217;s success can be incredibly fulfilling.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">• Fast-Growing Industry</h3>



<p>Despite the pandemic&#8217;s disruptions, supply chain careers have proven to be among the most resilient regarding salaries, job stability, and new opportunities. Moreover, as the global economy gradually recovers, there is an increased demand for raw materials, and warehousing requirements are shifting, making Logistics Management more complex.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This underscores the need for highly skilled Supply Chain Professionals, particularly those who can optimise supply chain performance. As a result, there will be even more opportunities for individuals seeking employment in the Supply Chain industry.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">• Improve Soft Skills</h3>



<p>Soft skills are crucial in any profession but significant in Supply Chain Management. These skills are just as essential as the formal and technical knowledge required among Supply Chain Professionals, as their role requires them to interact with others extensively.</p>



<p>As a result, as you progress in your supply chain career, you will inevitably improve your soft skills. This will enhance your prospects for internal career advancement and make you a desirable candidate for hiring managers or recruiters should you decide to explore new career opportunities.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">• Lucrative Careers</h3>



<p>The demand for Supply Chain Professionals is expected to rise due to increasing opportunities in the field. As a result, businesses compete for highly skilled talent, leading to competitive salaries, particularly for leadership roles.</p>

<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<p>To comprehend the scope of Financial Management, it is crucial to be familiar with four factors that Financial Managers consider while making decisions in an organisation. These factors include investment, financing, dividend, and Liquidity Decisions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">•Financing Decisions</h3>



<p>A Financial Manager must decide how to obtain sufficient funds to meet the firm&#8217;s requirements. This involves determining the appropriate balance between equity and debt, known as the firm&#8217;s capital structure. As a Financial Manager, you must strive to achieve an optimal capital structure while making financing decisions. An optimal capital structure is one in which the market value of shares is maximised.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">• Investment Decisions</h3>

<p>Long-term investment decisions, also known as Capital Budgeting, involve selecting the most appropriate investment proposal(s) by evaluating various factors to determine the one that aligns with the company&#8217;s goals and plans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, short-term investment decisions involve selecting the best use of funds in the short run, such as managing current assets.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">• Dividend Decisions</h3>



<p>Financial Management also encompasses the decision-making process related to dividend distribution. As a Financial Manager, you will have to evaluate various factors and determine the best course of action, such as distributing profits among shareholders, retaining them for future use, or distributing a specific portion and returning the rest to the company.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">• Liquidity Decisions</h3>



<p>Effective management of current assets is essential to maintain the profitability and liquidity of a firm. As a Financial Manager, your responsibility is to efficiently manage all existing assets to protect the firm from illiquidity risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This involves identifying and implementing the most appropriate techniques for current asset management, ensuring that funds are available when needed.</p>
