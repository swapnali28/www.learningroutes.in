<p>Enrolling in an MBA programme in Supply Chain Management helps you acquire all the essential business competencies required to effectively evaluate, oversee, and enhance the performance of supply chains across various organisations.</p>



<p>This sought-after MBA programme also equips you with the proficiency to comprehend and evaluate the interdependence among the vital functional units of a company and the external entities that contribute to the development, manufacturing, and delivery of products.</p>



<p>The curriculum primarily focuses on imparting fundamental knowledge about transportation, logistics, and distribution management in supply chain operations, which apply to both private and public sectors.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Supply Chain Management?</h2>



<p>Supply Chain Management involves managing goods from their raw material stage to their final product stage. This process encompasses everything up until the delivery of the final product to the customer. To optimise their organisation&#8217;s supply chain, professionals in this field use various techniques such as forecasting, enhancing inventory and transportation efficiency, cost reduction, understanding the flow of goods, and aligning supply chain networks.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Pursue Supply Chain Management?</h2>



<p>Regardless of their product range &#8211; cars, toys, aeroplane parts, t-shirts or toothpaste-all manufacturers rely on a supply chain to function. Effective management of supply chains can result in increased efficiency, reduced costs, improved management of supply and demand, and ultimately higher profits.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Supply Chain Management is a rapidly expanding field with a promising future. As the global supply chain continues to evolve and transform, the demand for professionals with expertise in supply chain management, strategy creation, execution and optimisation will only increase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thus, there will be ample opportunities for individuals with relevant education and skills to pursue a fulfilling career in this field. Here are a few reasons why you should opt for an MBA in Supply Chain Management</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">• Increased Scope</h3>



<p>The supply chain encompasses all aspects of a product&#8217;s life cycle, including acquisition, distribution, allocation, and delivery. The scope of this field is expanding rapidly due to technological advancements such as Blockchain and Cloud Computing.</p>



<p>As a Supply Chain Professional, your organisation will rely on you to predict market trends, ensure proper staffing, ensure timely delivery of parts, and react swiftly to unexpected issues. You will be an expert in prioritisation and can efficiently execute tasks, ultimately enabling others to perform their roles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The satisfaction that comes from being a driving force behind a team&#8217;s success can be incredibly fulfilling.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">• Fast-Growing Industry</h3>



<p>Despite the pandemic&#8217;s disruptions, supply chain careers have proven to be among the most resilient regarding salaries, job stability, and new opportunities. Moreover, as the global economy gradually recovers, there is an increased demand for raw materials, and warehousing requirements are shifting, making Logistics Management more complex.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This underscores the need for highly skilled Supply Chain Professionals, particularly those who can optimise supply chain performance. As a result, there will be even more opportunities for individuals seeking employment in the Supply Chain industry.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">• Improve Soft Skills</h3>



<p>Soft skills are crucial in any profession but significant in Supply Chain Management. These skills are just as essential as the formal and technical knowledge required among Supply Chain Professionals, as their role requires them to interact with others extensively.</p>



<p>As a result, as you progress in your supply chain career, you will inevitably improve your soft skills. This will enhance your prospects for internal career advancement and make you a desirable candidate for hiring managers or recruiters should you decide to explore new career opportunities.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">• Lucrative Careers</h3>



<p>The demand for Supply Chain Professionals is expected to rise due to increasing opportunities in the field. As a result, businesses compete for highly skilled talent, leading to competitive salaries, particularly for leadership roles.</p>



<p>Despite being viewed by some as functional and mundane, supply chain careers can be lucrative. Supply Chain Professionals are well-rewarded, whether motivated by financial returns or career growth.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">• Financially Rewarding</h3>



<p>The average salary earned by a Supply Chain Manager is around 8,00,000 per annum, which can even hit the 80 Lakhs per annum mark depending on the location and the project you work on.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">• Travel Abroad</h3>



<p>Certain logistics positions involve frequent overseas travel, primarily work-related activities rather than tourism. Nonetheless, such trips provide numerous prospects for individuals aspiring to enter the international business arena.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Scope of Supply Chain Management</h2>



<p>A Supply Chain Management programme is attractive to individuals who are already working professionals as they seek to enhance their professional abilities by pursuing a master&#8217;s degree. The popularity of this program stems from the potential it offers and the benefits it provides to working individuals.</p>



<p>The programme&#8217;s curriculum facilitates the development of a deeper understanding of the significance of supply chains and enables students to learn about international and domestic markets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, the training equips individuals with knowledge that empowers them to view things from a new perspective, enhancing their comprehension of the subject matter. Pursuing an MBA in Supply Chain Management also provides the opportunity to learn something new every day, making it a stimulating and dynamic field of study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With such a breadth of knowledge to explore, students will not find themselves bored or stuck in a routine.</p>
