<p>In many ways, a resume is the first step toward your future career, as it’s usually the first thing a hiring manager sees. It’s important to make a good impression by presenting a clean and concise resume that details your qualifications for the open role. In this article, we define what a resume is and provide tips for creating one that will leave a lasting impression.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1">What is a resume?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>A resume is a document that showcases a candidate’s qualifications for a job. It often includes their education, experience, skills, and achievements. A resume is a great way to showcase how you could be an asset to the company. Having a polished resume is a great way to set yourself apart from other candidates applying for the same job. When creating a resume, it’s also important to understand the industry you’re working in as well as the hiring company you’re applying to tailor your resume to both.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Make sure there is a fit</strong></h2>



<p>First, make sure you have a case. Your job experience must align with what the employer is looking for in advertisement.</p>



<p>This need to find the fit between the job posting and your background does not mean “fake it till you make it” as the expression goes. Nor does it mean telling white lies and inventing experience or inserting keywords that you can’t defend. It does mean applying only for those positions that align with your experience and achievements.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Don’t be afraid to brag about your skills on your resume</strong></h2>



<p>Think of your resume as an abbreviated quarterly report or project debrief that you’d deliver at work: It needs to provide context, details, and results to reflect the hard work that went into making something a success. Therefore, being your own cheerleader is essential. So is making sure your responsibilities or day-to-day tasks don’t outweigh the measurable accomplishments throughout your most recent roles. If tooting your own horn isn’t something you feel particularly comfortable with,&nbsp;hiring a professional resume writer&nbsp;can help take the pressure off.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Customize for the job you want</h2>



<p>Respond directly to the job description and explain exactly why you are the candidate for the role. You can do this by relating your accomplishments to the elements of the job role.</p>



<p>Employers want candidates to understand the role they are applying for, and the more you can demonstrate this, the more your resume will stand out.</p>



<p>It might take longer for you to write your resume, especially when applying for a large number of roles, but if it helps you to find your perfect position then it is time well spent!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Show industry insight</h2>



<p>An awareness of the industry you are applying for will show the recruiter that you have the ability to stay on top of trends. You will be a lot more attractive to employers if you are able to demonstrate knowledge of the industry, so make sure you are up to date with any news and industry changes. This will also help you if you reach the interview stage.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Use power words</h2>



<p>Using power words will emphasize your accomplishments and will give your CV additional impact. Include words such as&nbsp;<strong><em>adaptable</em>,&nbsp;<em>innovative</em>,&nbsp;<em>implemented,</em></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>achieved</em>&nbsp;for each of your roles, and follow up with impressive results or outcomes which demonstrate what you have delivered. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Many companies use&nbsp;database software&nbsp;to filter out candidates who don’t use certain keywords, so make sure you study the job description and know what the recruiter is looking for. &nbsp;</p>
