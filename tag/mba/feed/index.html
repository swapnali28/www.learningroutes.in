<p>For freshers aspiring to become entrepreneurs, pursuing an MBA can be a valuable tool in charting their path towards success. While embarking on the journey of entrepreneurship can be thrilling, it can also be a daunting prospect. In such circumstances, the advantages of an MBA programme can be instrumental in simplifying the process of becoming an entrepreneur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By equipping individuals with skills like business planning, marketing, strategy, and finance, an MBA provides them with the knowledge and tools they need to make critical decisions and run a successful venture.</p>



<p>While an MBA is not a mandatory requirement for success as an entrepreneur, it can offer several benefits. It helps individuals gain a deeper understanding of market trends, customer needs, and the overall business environment, allowing them to make more informed decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, an <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/nmims-distance-mba-admission-2022/">MBA</a> can provide individuals with a competitive edge over their peers, offering them the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in a highly competitive business landscape.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">6 Ways an MBA Can Make You a Better Entrepreneur</h1>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VeAsNvu18Qn1Sq7RKzbbM1UxTDhUGBT9z-wlyHJqV9eFw0qu-sZeVb-nNdmm1xlNc90Th9KMNKiS_OetvXEA4AC0EQqwOzN2O8y65lSryhwWKNBruTfo97A_OcE2e7y6zYPEsng2qXB-AsEXdZ03f14" alt="" width="595" height="293"/></figure>



<p>Running a business is a challenging journey that involves uncertainty, ambiguity, and risk. Navigating the business world can be difficult if you don’t have a solid plan in mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, pursuing an MBA degree can provide you with a safe and reliable path to becoming a successful entrepreneur. In addition, an MBA programme can also provide you with the relevant knowledge and skills to manage a business effectively.</p>



<p>If you are confused, here are several ways in which an MBA degree can help individuals become better entrepreneurs:</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Learning Diverse Business Skills</strong></h3>



<p>As an entrepreneur, you will often find yourself juggling between various roles, such as CEO, Accountant, Marketer, and more. This is especially true for small business owners with limited resources to hire additional staff. For such individuals, pursuing an MBA can be a valuable way to develop a broad range of business skills to help them succeed in any role.</p>



<p>As an MBA programme covers various subjects, from accounting and finance to marketing and operations. Through the programme, you will learn various important skills including business strategy, organisational behaviour, and economics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, you will also get a chance to develop <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/7-skills-that-employers-want-to-see-in-fresh-graduates/">essential skills</a> like negotiation, public speaking, and teamwork. If you have a particular interest or passion, such as global management, you can specialise in that by pursuing an on-campus or online MBA programme in that field.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Fostering Global Perspective</strong></h3>



<p>With the rising popularity of business schools globally, pursuing an MBA degree offers an excellent opportunity to meet and interact with people from diverse cultural backgrounds. This can broaden one&#8217;s perspectives and foster a global mindset, essential in today&#8217;s interconnected world.</p>



<p>In addition, a global mindset also offers personal growth and financial benefits to organisations. According to a study, companies with an international outlook tend to perform better financially. In addition, they are better equipped to navigate cultural differences and build relationships with stakeholders worldwide.</p>



<p>As per World Economic Forum, by the year 2025, most of the global workforce will comprise millennials and Generation Z. As these generations value diversity and inclusion; therefore, businesses that prioritise these values can attract and retain top talent.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Learning Your Way</strong></h3>



<p>If you are an entrepreneur who values independence and innovation, pursuing an MBA could be a perfect choice. MBA programmes are designed to be flexible and accessible for busy working professionals, with online options available at affordable prices.</p>



<p>One of the key benefits of an MBA programme is the freedom and autonomy it provides. With a wide range of elective courses and opportunities to tailor your education to your unique interests and goals, you can focus on the areas of business that interest you the most.</p>



<p>Lastly, by enrolling in an MBA programme, you can combine your independent spirit with the knowledge and skills you need to succeed in business. So if you&#8217;re looking for a way to take your entrepreneurial ambitions to the next level, an MBA could be just what you need.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Expanding Your Network</strong></h3>



<p>Entrepreneurs know the importance of networking. In fact, their success often hinges on the strength of their connections. A robust network can provide fresh ideas, perspectives, and insights into new products, technologies, and business growth strategies.</p>



<p>An MBA programme offers access to like-minded and ambitious individuals who share your passion for business. Your classmates and professors can be valuable resources and sounding boards for ideas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, MBA programmes also organise networking events and career fairs, which enable students to connect with business leaders and potential employers. These events not only allow you to expand your network but also stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and practices.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Obtaining Leadership Skills</strong></h3>



<p>Becoming a successful entrepreneur is not just about having great ideas; it also involves leading a team towards success. Unfortunately, not everyone is a born leader, and 77% of businesses report a lack of leadership in their organisation. This is where pursuing an MBA programme can be beneficial for business owners, as it emphasises interpersonal skills development, which is essential for effective leadership.</p>



<p>MBA programmes offer courses in management, communication, and organisational behaviour that can give students a deeper understanding of what makes a great leader. Additionally, MBA students can put their leadership skills into practice through various projects and internships. For example, they may lead a team to complete a consulting project for a client or take up a leadership role in a student-run club or organisation. These experiences allow them to apply their learning in real-world situations and gain valuable feedback and insights.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Learning Risk Management</strong></h3>



<p>An MBA programme can be a game-changer for entrepreneurs when it comes to managing risks and making informed decisions. In the unpredictable business world, risks are inevitable, but an MBA programme can equip you with the skills to assess and manage them effectively.</p>



<p>While some entrepreneurs may rely on intuition, an MBA programme emphasises the importance of informed decision-making based on market analysis and data-driven insights. You will learn to identify the right factors, make calculated investments, and make strategic moves to propel your business forward.</p>



<p>In short, pursuing an MBA can give you the superpowers you need to navigate the challenges of the business world with confidence and make decisions that will help you stay ahead of the competition.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Top MBA Programmes for Entrepreneurs</h2>



<p>If you are planning on running your own business but are not sure about which MBA programme to opt for; the following list will help you clear your doubts.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Post Graduate Programme in Management (PGP)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>MBA in Entrepreneurship &amp; Family Business&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>MBA (Entrepreneurship)&nbsp;</td><td>MBA (Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>MBA in Sales Leadership</td><td>MBA in Product Management</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Entrepreneurs wondering whether pursuing an MBA is worth it should know that the answer is a resounding &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The benefits that an MBA can provide, such as networking opportunities, exposure to diverse perspectives, leadership training, and access to experienced mentors, are invaluable for entrepreneurs as they pitch their ideas, plan new ventures, and develop strategies for funding and growth. In some cases, entrepreneurs may forge new paths and create business models for which no established benchmarks exist. As an entrepreneur with an MBA, you will be better equipped to navigate the challenges of breaking new ground and to overcome the naysayers who claim, &#8220;It has never been done that way before.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><em>“Who looks outside; dreams, Who looks inside, awakes”</em></strong></p><cite><strong><em>&#8211; Carl Jung</em></strong></cite></blockquote>



<p>As per Carl Jung, if you want to know anything about anything, be it a person, business, product, or relationship, between two things or even if you&#8217;re going to win a war, it comes from pieces of information and information comes from within. To have a clear understanding of the question of whether or not it is good to do an MBA after a Bachelor’s in Psychology, we need to understand how Psychology can be used in Business Management. Especially what are the aspects you can address that a non-psychology student can&#8217;t? To cut it short, understand how you can use psychology in your responsibilities to increase your overall performance as a manager. Now the question that comes to mind is: </p>



<p><strong>What are the Skills Required as a “BUSINESS MANAGER”?</strong></p>



<p>Business Management is among the top-ranked careers and with the fast pace of development, it is expected to rise beyond imagination. <strong><em>“Change will be happening so quickly that 50% of the occupations that exist today will not exist 10 years from now. So we’re going to be living in an environment that is extremely adaptable and changing all the time,”</em></strong> says Liz Bentley, the founder of Liz Bentley Associates. Thus, it can be interpreted that Business Management is here to stay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every company anywhere in the world is looking for a person who has foundational knowledge and can convert them into unique skills because “the bossy” attitude and approach is not going to work in a tight labour market where “logical reason” is everything. Skills like reasoning, negotiation, organising resources, leadership and relationship building with your management, colleagues and subordinates are of utmost importance. As there is a saying in defence forces</p>



<p><strong><em>“TAKE CARE OF YOUR MEN AND THE MEN WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU!”</em></strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/POC8SoGXgrpKZwgJgjshUSY2AdIBX8Ck0nE_vGmQ77cg_4kS2UlNns2tkMTJcWEvlVsdiP4OdS76c8Y759B00h3xe8vCCNDKnY7-gpDwqnApabIl6kpPV2XnmGeh5wqAdxymdmqvbtnU50IWkNdB2LB58t8_lQrw4xGM0dBckPXnfZz0N8FMUptFdpLAwQ" alt=""/></figure>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Skills Required by Business Managers</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Technology Management Skills</strong></h4>



<p>The change the world, especially India, has seen in the last 20 years in terms of technology deployment and involvement in workplaces is drastic. From no Internet, and working on hard copies to 5G and software management systems, the world has changed a lot. Those who didn&#8217;t keep up faced many difficulties. “To grow together” is the only option we all have.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Out Centric Leadership Skills</strong></h4>



<p>As per definition the person who leads or commands a group, an organisation, or a country. But a true leader knows way beyond that! Taking care of your people while making sure everything grows with it. Building teams or growing a business is an integral part of it, this is where psychology steps in. Having a clear understanding of the people you work with, about their strengths and weaknesses also falls under the responsibility of the leader.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Soft-Skill Assessment</strong></h4>



<p><strong><em>“Effective managers are going to have to be as good at evaluating candidates and employees for soft skills as they are for technical skills,”</em></strong> says Rita Santelli, CEO of innovation consulting firm Savvy. If there is no good communication there is no growth because subordinates will not be able to share ideas, problems and solutions. Other soft skills that are important from a business point of view are time management, critical thinking, problem-solving and a few others. If a manager has learnt to establish the right balance of these skills, that’s when he is able to truly use psychology in his day-to-day managerial responsibilities.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Results-Only Work Environment</strong></h4>



<p>Over the years increased productivity is the end goal of any company which involves the maximum input from everyone i.e. individual productivity increase. Addressing issues leads to increased efficiency which comes from an understanding of the environment and persons.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Transparency</strong></h4>



<p>A shift from a non-traditional way, requires answers for what, why and how. Transparency plays a vital role to answer those questions because it builds trust among colleagues. Trust allows you to have strong connections and which further leads to an effective and highly motivated team.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Emotional Intelligence</strong></h4>



<p>As a leader, it is very important to understand and recognise your own emotions as well the emotions of those around you. It helps you bring strong bonds with your team and helps you establish an atmosphere of cooperation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Don’t these skills make you believe that as a psychology student, you are the perfect fit for managerial positions? Then why not increase your chances by pursuing an MBA degree?</p>



<p>The understanding of human behaviour that you have already gives you an upper hand over others. During your MBA, you will acquire valuable hard and soft skills that will prepare you to traverse through the thick waters of the business world.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hard and Soft Skills Necessary for Business Administration:&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>HARD SKILLS</strong></td><td><strong>SOFT SKILLS</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Critical Reasoning</td><td>Communication</td></tr><tr><td>Psychology and Cognitive Science Fundamentals</td><td>Critical Thinking</td></tr><tr><td>Quantitative and Qualitative Research</td><td>Listening</td></tr><tr><td>Experiment Design</td><td>Empathy</td></tr><tr><td>Experiential Learning</td><td>Creative Problem Solving</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The best and the most important part that will act as a catalyst in your career of business management is <strong>“BEHAVIOURAL PSYCHOLOGY.”</strong></p>



<p>The systematic approach to understanding the behaviour of humans is behaviourism or behavioural sciences. With this knowledge, you will be able to understand the behavioural patterns of your colleagues, will know them better, how they are as an individual, how you as a manager take out their most productive self and much more. You can also enhance these skills while doing an MBA.</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Career Prospects for Psychology Students after MBA&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>As we have read and understood that psychology students can make great leaders, hence, it is also easy for them to tap into the job market. Studies have shown that only 34% of the people come from a management field but on the other hand, 66% of the people come from non-management fields into managerial positions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are some of the job prospects in Business Management that a psychology student can pursue after MBA:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Corporate Leaders&nbsp;</li><li>Human Resource Professionals</li><li>Social Worker Executives&nbsp;</li><li>Industrial Counselor</li><li>Corporate Consultant, and many others.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>The amalgamation of psychology and MBA is drastic and it opens doors of job possibilities for the students. Additionally, these jobs are highly lucrative and are expected to contribute to the job market in the long run.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h3>



<p>There is no doubt that an MBA will be beneficial for you after a bachelor&#8217;s in psychology. It will not only help you to elevate your career but will also bring opportunities for personality development.</p>

<p>Most Indian parents want their children to pursue a management degree due to the many perks it has to offer. But ever since globalisation has expanded its roots formal education has taken a back seat. Hence the students are in a dilemma whether to pursue a degree or not.

<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Should You Pursue Formal Education to Land a CEO Position?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>People are not born with the in-built skills of a CEO. They need assistance during their education to inculcate the right skills. A management degree can accelerate this process. Also, if you do your course from a recognized business school, considering the placement opportunities, networking opportunities, curriculum, etc., can also boost your business mindset development. In India, some of the top B-Schools are IIMs, Narsee Monjee Institute of Management, Amity University, Chandigarh University among others</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Which Course Should You Choose to Become a CEO?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>So far we have discovered the importance of a management degree. Now, let’s take this conversation to the next level. If you think about it, you would want to pick an MBA if you want an up and running successful business because of many reasons. But Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies and other prestigious universities in India also offers a course called “Executive MBA”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Coursera <em>“An Executive MBA (EMBA) is an advanced business degree program designed for professionals who are about 10 to 15 years into their careers.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/nmims-executive-mba-wx-programs/">NMIMS’ executive MBA</a> is a 24-month course that is thoughtfully crafted and packed with skill-based knowledge. The university offers five specialisations in this course, namely: &#8211;&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Marketing</li><li>Digital Marketing</li><li>Applied Finance</li><li>Operations and Supply Chain</li><li>Leadership and Strategy</li></ol>



<p>Moreover, they have collaborated with Harvard Business School&nbsp; to provide an optional certificate course for value addition, thus, exposing students to the global education system.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tn5BxvDmDoR-deZLNg_AmpzSMbDe1wnzGGFQzxYYVx1oecqlzW04uWOtjwIryHlLvmhXg031Z0P8fwLKg_uqDBn3Oc_BUGKrYVJZ7mQRwykCTZK8bRyBo8ULD3BRj9zmW_GroYtSEAW3WVYUB9AeJfU" alt=""/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is Executive MBA Better than MBA?</strong></h3>



<p>You must be wondering why an Executive MBA is better than an MBA. There are a lot of similarities in the course such as duration, application process, test requirements, etc. but EMBA has an edge because the individual already has 10 to 12 years of corporate experience so as to build something of his own.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>According to Caryn L. Beck-Dudley, the president and CEO of AACSB International, the enrollment in executive courses has increased to 68%.</em></strong> This degree is meant for working professionals who want to land leadership positions in organisations. It is an ideal way to give a push to your career if you are at a standstill.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Final Thoughts&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>We are sure you can come up with many reasons and examples saying a management degree is not necessary but we are saying that an MBA or an Executive MBA can help accelerate the process. You get to build a network, learn how theoretical knowledge can be executed to practical projects. Through the capstone projects and internships students learn how to work in a team which is imperative to build a business.&nbsp;</p>
