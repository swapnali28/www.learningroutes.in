										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On January 5, 2023, the University Grants Commission (UGC) released a draft stating that India is officially open to welcoming foreign universities in the country. This will transform India’s approach to higher education and benefit the students incredibly. But it also raises many questions. How will the government safeguard the interest of our country? Why did this draft not get approval in the previous years? Will foreign universities be given complete autonomy? Are these universities willing to hire Indian professors &amp; teachers? And what does the future of India&#8217;s higher education look like?&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s This Noise About Foreign Universities Entering the Indian Market?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>According to the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/foreign-universities-india-campus-8366318/">UGC report</a>, many <strong>“European Countries”</strong> are interested in expanding their roots in India. The <strong>University of Birmingham</strong> released an official response which said, <em>“We are always open to opportunities for partnership working. We would also point Indian students toward the excellent study opportunities available at the University of Birmingham in both UK and Dubai.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Another college that is<strong> King’s College, London has signed MoU with the government of Telangana</strong> for collaborative research, staff &amp; student exchange, curriculum development, and upskilling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These collaborations and the keen interest of foreign universities in Indian institutions is a testimony to the fact that India is an excellent economy to invest in.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Attracts Foreign Investment in India?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Studies have shown that after the United States, India currently has the second-largest higher education system. Thus, the education sector in our nation has a very high potential for growth. The market for distance education was valued at 39 billion in 2018, and by 2024, it is expected to rise to 360 billion. By the end of 2020, there were more than 988 universities and about 40,000 colleges already established in India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the AISHE stats, the gross enrollment ratio has grown by 0.8%, with a constant increase of 18.2% in female enrollments. This level of growth necessitates significant financial commitment which is not feasible simply through the government. As a result, it encourages and supports investments from the private sector. Furthermore, it promotes foreign direct investment in the sector.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The NEP 2020 Vision</strong></h3>



<p>The latest UGC draft is in line with National Education Policy 2020 (NEP). NEP envisioned the internationalisation of higher education and stated its vision that “top universities in the world will be facilitated to operate in India.” It reflects that the government has thoughtfully taken this action to attract foreign investment in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The UGC Draft</strong></h3>



<p>The draft was announced by the UGC Chairman, Dr. M Jagadesh Kumar which laid down the following key points:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>The universities that are among the top 500 in QS Ranking in the overall category or subject-wise category are eligible to apply in India&nbsp;</li><li>If the universities do not participate in such rankings then they must be reputable in their country</li><li>The foreign university can decide its fee structure, hiring process, admission process, and the Indian government will not have any say in such matters</li><li>The foreign universities can repatriate to their parent university</li><li>The courses offered by these universities should not be against the interest of India’s interests and beliefs&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/MBVi5iFH67Jf8Cca-cvAU0_vVFmExVvYT-2gTEaS7VXX2-UrI_dDWWVyvYT8igVH82QKH0x_8oydlUXJZdwjYNahMV-OiS7n277XKRb7fJTI9HiYE8jOg4jsXs4jUMS5_zs4AOSZrDcX3Vm2RGP20HkLjTjqIMd25Esy59svpFoVfOpeQ_QqbO43Z9IUXQ" alt="" width="737" height="366"/></figure></div>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Have Foreign Universities Received Complete Autonomy?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>According to the official draft, the Indian government will not interfere in matters of foreign universities. They have been given the freedom to set their fee structure for both Indian and international students.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They are also not obligated to follow the reservation system that is popular in India otherwise. Additionally, they can also follow their own process for hiring.</p>



<p>Although the draft did mention that they are advised to include scholarships by Foreign Higher Educational Institution (FHEI). Furthermore, the government has said that the fee structure should be “transparent and reasonable.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ceqTzQgRDlFO6mZvTJwPEKEErLV6Xp7fUCLs9JIDlRerhsFmkPpZri0-DH4lJE8MvBvAYDbykidWTSXb2EvyINaEcP_BpIlGppZdViEecqn6tdAXCPBn6-4_iENeY_jmAgJjiMdVMvCgp9s1bhIVX8Gym4TJm1qVFHWJfVvIgEiG-MMNhzvtRjKQ_QpgJQ" alt="" width="400" height="319"/></figure></div>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How does the Government Safeguard Indian Interests?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The UGC has set the following parameters to safeguard the Indian national interests:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>The UGC can examine the university campuses at any time&nbsp;</li><li>The universities have to abide by India’s anti-ragging and other criminal law policies</li><li>The UGC can suspend or withdraw the university’s approval if its actions are against the policies of India</li><li>The foreign universities have to submit an audit and annual report stating that their working is in line with Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999</li></ol>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How is It Beneficial?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“Presence of Foreign Higher Education Institutions here will enable Indian students obtain foreign qualifications at affordable cost, and make India an attractive study destination.”</em></p><cite>M Jagadesh Kumar, UGC Chairperson&nbsp;</cite></blockquote>



<p></p>



<p>Although it is too early to say anything but majorly the benefits that can be seen of foreign university entering higher education sector in India are:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Foreign students will invest in the courses. Thus, it will directly contribute the country’s GDP</li><li>In order to compete with these universities, IITs, IIMs, private universities will also make necessary changes in their curriculum, opportunities and other procedures</li><li>It is easier for Indian students to study in their dream universities yet stay in the country</li><li>It will also reduce visa and other immigration issues&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>This is broadly what the new UGC policy looks like and in the coming future we will unfold more information. Till then visit our page for more updates.</p>

<p>The new National Education Policy (NEP), which was approved by the Union Cabinet, is expected to bring a flurry of reforms, ranging from school curriculum reductions to the abolition of MPhil programs.</p>



<p>The NEP aspires to develop an education system that directly contributes to the country&#8217;s transformation by delivering high-quality education to all citizens and developing India into a global knowledge superpower.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New system of education</strong></h2>



<p>The new education policy 2021 was adopted by the Modi government. The 10 + 2 structure has been fully eliminated in the new education policy. Our country&#8217;s educational curriculum has been based on 10 + 2, but it will soon be based on 5+ 3+ 3+ 4. This means that one-half is from primary to second grade, the second portion is from third to fifth grade, the third part is from sixth to eighth grade, and the last part is from ninth to 12th grade. Learn about the 5 + 3 + 3 + 4 format in this article.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll provide you a quick overview of the &#8220;New Education Policy 2021,&#8221; including the Scheme Benefits, Key Features.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>New Education Policy 2021 – Overview</strong></td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>Name of Scheme</td><td><strong>New Education Policy 2021 (NEP)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>in&nbsp;<strong>Language</strong></td><td><strong>नई</strong><strong>शिक्षा</strong><strong>नीति</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Name of Ministry</td><td>Union Cabinet Minister for Human Resource Development, Government of India</td></tr><tr><td>HRD Minister</td><td>Dr. Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank</td></tr><tr><td>Launched by</td><td>Central Government of India</td></tr><tr><td>Beneficiaries</td><td>Students of India</td></tr><tr><td>Major Benefit</td><td>Provide New Reforms and Infrastructure In India</td></tr><tr><td><strong>New Education Policy 2021 2020 Launched Date</strong></td><td>29 July 2020</td></tr><tr><td><strong>NEP 2020 implementation date</strong></td><td>Available Soon</td></tr><tr><td>Scheme Objective</td><td>Education System Reform</td></tr><tr><td>Scheme under</td><td>State Government</td></tr><tr><td>Name of State</td><td><strong>All India</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Post Category</td><td>Scheme/ Yojana</td></tr><tr><td>Official Website</td><td><strong><a href="https://www.mhrd.gov.in/">https://www.mhrd.gov.in</a></strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><strong>Let&#8217;s Understand everything about NEP.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the NEP?</strong></h2>



<p>The Indian government&#8217;s New Education Policy is referred to as NEP. It was last modified in 1992 after being drafted in 1986. The Modi-led BJP government vowed in its election manifesto to create a new education policy, or NEP, to bring about changes in the education sector.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who created NEP?</strong></h2>



<p>A panel of specialists, led by former ISRO chief K Kasturirangan, discussed the difficulties and adjustments that need to be made in the Indian education system, which included everything from school to college to recruitment. These proposals were gathered, and the Ministry then approved them.</p>



<p><em><strong>Its Important Highlights:</strong></em></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Schooling starts at the age of 3 years now</strong></h3>



<p>The New Education Policy extends compulsory schooling from the age bracket of 6-14 years to 3-18 years. The NEP includes three years of previously unrecognized pre-schooling for children aged 3-6 years in the school curriculum. The new system will include 12 years of formal education and three years of Anganwadi/pre-school education.</p>



<p>The 10+2 school curriculum framework will be replaced with a 5+3+3+4 curricular structure corresponding to ages 3-8, 8-11, 11-14, and 14-18 years, respectively, with an emphasis on Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mother tongue as medium of instruction</strong></h3>



<p>The NEP emphasizes pupils&#8217; native language as the medium of teaching while adhering to the &#8220;three-language formula&#8221; and ensuring that no language is imposed on anyone. The NEP simply suggests using the mother tongue as a medium of instruction rather than making it mandatory.</p>



<p>According to the policy paper, children learn and grasp non-trivial topics faster in their native language.</p>



<p>The home language, mother tongue, local language, or regional language will be used as the medium of instruction until at least Grade 5, but preferably until Grade 8 and beyond. Following that, wherever practicable, the home or local language will be taught as a language. &#8220;Both public and private schools will follow this,&#8221; the regulation adds.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>NO UGC, AICTE, NCTE</strong></h3>



<p>The Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) will be established as a single umbrella body for all higher education in India, excluding medical and legal education. Regulation, accreditation, and academic standards will all be governed by the same set of rules for public and private higher education institutions.</p>



<p>In 15 years, the government will phase down college affiliation, and a stage-by-stage procedure for providing colleges with graded autonomy will be formed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Science, arts, commerce gets blurred</strong></h3>



<p>There would be no formal distinctions between arts and sciences, curricular and extra-curricular activities, or vocational and academic programs under NEP 2020. Students can choose from a variety of disciplines throughout the streams. Internships will be included in vocational education, which will begin in sixth grade.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>FYUP Programme Returns &amp; No More Dropouts</strong></h3>



<p>Under the NEP, undergraduate degrees will last three or four years, with several exit alternatives available during that time. After one year of study in a topic or field, including vocational and professional fields, colleges will be required to award a certificate, a diploma following two years of study, or a Bachelor&#8217;s degree after a three-year program.</p>



<p>The government will also create an Academic Bank of Credit to store academic credits earned at various HEIs digitally so that they can be transferred and counted toward a final degree.</p>



<p>Finally, based on the foregoing points, we can conclude that this policy implements much-needed adjustments. There was no uniform system in place, which has now been eliminated. It has more transparency and a single national agency in charge of overseeing the whole education system in the country.</p>

<p><strong>Data analytics</strong> is giving a strong edge to companies. The use of Data analytics is a skill that is gaining conventional value due to the progressively thinner margin for decision blunder. There is a need to gain insights, anticipate and interpret raw transactional data that many companies now store in a digital platform.</p>



<p><em><strong>Business Intelligence and Data analytics</strong> </em>and Decisions One can find a fine way to segregate business intelligence (BI) from data analytics and decisions. Analytics streamlines the data to channelize its value. The supreme goal of analytics is to turn high volumes of data into a much smaller amount of information and insight to which can give you a real-time figure. BI usually summarizes historical data logically in table reports and graphs as a resource for questions and answers. But reports do not simplify data nor intensify its value rather simplify the data so it can be understood and consumed.</p>



<p>As opposed to BI, decision give objective to what to analyze. Circles the decision in mind. Identify the decision that matter most to your company and model what prompts settling on those decisions. By understanding the type of decision required, at that point the kind of analysis and its important data source can be identified.</p>



<p>To explain, BI consumes stored info. Analytics produces new info. Predictive business analytics influences data within a company’s function focused on analytics and having the mandate, skills, and abilities to drive better, faster results and achieve desired performance in fraction of seconds.</p>



<p>Queries using BI tools purely answer general questions. Business analytics makes questions. Additionally, analytics then stimulate more complex and interesting questions. Majorly data analytics also has the ability to answer the questions. In conclusion, predictive business analytics can show the possibilities of outcomes based on the assumptions of variables. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics">Data analytics</a> was once the area of “quants” and statistical nerds creating models.

Following selection, the data is evaluated and classified by necessity, and research is conducted to examine purchase habits and other factors.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why is data analytics becoming more popular? The following are the points:</strong></span></strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Examine the value chain of the business</strong></h4>



<p>Data mining will assist you to gain insights into the value chains that are currently in your firm. As a result, the analytics would highlight how the company&#8217;s current knowledge will enable it to identify the gold mine that is the way to a company&#8217;s greatness.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Industry expertise</strong></h4>



<p>After you&#8217;ve analysed the data, you can learn about industry awareness, which might show what your company will be like in the near future and what the economy&#8217;s current strength is. This is because you will be able to profit before everyone else.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Possibilities</strong></h4>



<p>Because the economy changes to keep up with dynamic advances, and benefit generation is the most common goal followed by businesses, Data Analytics gives analyzed data that allows them to explore more options ahead of time.</p>
