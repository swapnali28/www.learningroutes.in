										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Have you ever noticed that you continue to come across the “sports shoes” you were looking for a long time ago all over the internet? Welcome to the digital age my friend!</p>



<p>Gone are the days when consumer data was used only by advertising agencies to improve their performance. Today, AI and ML algorithms rule the world and pretty much direct our life choices. Therefore, it is no wonder that for every industry, data has become the new gold.</p>



<p>From Metaverse to ChatGPT, we have all witnessed the power of Artificial Intelligence. From Gaming to Banking to Finance, AI is revolutionising every sector. According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/reenitadas/2017/10/05/how-big-data-could-help-to-prevent-one-fatal-heart-attack-every-40-seconds/?sh=4aa156ea2089"><strong>Forbes</strong></a>, companies like IBM, Optum, and Hitachi are putting in a lot of effort to use &#8220;population health analytics&#8221; to improve the accuracy of stroke and heart attack predictions.</p>



<p>But there’s one industry that this breakthrough technology has taken by storm. Marketing! That’s right. Not only do AI and ML algorithms dictate the present of Marketing but they very much control the future of marketing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The big question that’s in front of us is “will AI overtake all the jobs in the near future?” And if so, why are humans trying to transform and imbed EQ in technology? Let’s find out!</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Artificial Intelligence?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Let’s address the elephant in the room, Artificial Intelligence or AI. According to Google&#8217;s definition, Artificial Intelligence is <em>“the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Simply put, Artificial Intelligence is like Dr. Sheldon Cooper (from <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>); a “know-it-all”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Until quite recently, businesses used the term “artificial intelligence” to refer to software that is capable of learning and improving on the job without human input. But today, the sphere of AI has grown even wider. Now, these algorithms can even assist you with tasks that call for thought, emotion, and judgement.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How AI is transforming the Marketing Sector?</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/5-ways-AI-elevates-marketing-copy-1-896x1024.jpg" alt="5 ways AI elevates marketing" class="wp-image-11144" width="474" height="541"/></figure></div>



<p>Studies have shown that, in the year 2019, more than 88% of marketers adopted AI and the results have been exhilarating. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/190858/most-effective-online-marketing-channels-according-to-us-companies/"><strong>Statista</strong></a>, currently, the most effective digital marketing technique is Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it does not end there. One of the contributing factors to these staggeringly high statistics is the inability of humans to analyse big data. Imagine, Facebook or Google start analysing the day-to-day trends and habits of the entire population of over 8 billion individuals. Clearly, that’s not possible. And that’s where AI steps in, to understand customer behaviour and offer customised solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before online advertising, companies spent thousands and thousands of money on TV, radio, and newspaper advertisements. Although they were aware of the fact that only a small percentage of people will see these commercials and even smaller would become their “potential customers” let alone customers. Indubitably, it was an incredibly ineffective method, businesses had no choice but to do it if they wanted to establish themselves as market leaders.</p>



<p>The first breakthrough in the marketing industry was when Amazon introduced its “recommendation engine technology” and Facebook and Google aligned their programming with Machine Learning through “targeted advertising platforms”. And today, as we see every e-commerce platform is following its footsteps.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are Some of the AI Tools Used by Marketers?&nbsp;</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/AI-marketing-tools-1.jpeg" alt="AI marketing tools" class="wp-image-11143" width="416" height="416"/></figure></div>



<p>Now, that we have a hang of what AI is and how useful it can be, let’s look at some of the tools that are used by marketers:&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Smartwriter.ai</h3>



<p>You may automate your email outreach with Smartwriter.ai. This AI technology creates customised emails with a unique subject line to grab clients&#8217; attention. Additionally, it creates product titles and descriptions for various products.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Optimove&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Optimove is a consumer-based data platform with AI leading the marketing. In order to present a consolidated picture of the different kinds of information available over a single dashboard, it assists in collecting data from various sources. It helps the companies to decide on marketing strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Its tool, Optibot, looks into all the consumer data available to it so as to gather useful insights. For example, it can offer you valuable insights on which ads to stop running based to curb the losses or which clients must receive corporate communication.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. InstaText&nbsp;</h3>



<p>InstaText is an online AI-powered writing tool. It not only helps you perform basic tasks like grammar and spell checks but goes one step further and enhances the readability of your content by rewriting sentences. It guarantees that the tone and style of the writer are maintained despite the rewriting.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Brand24&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Brands can monitor both positive and negative social media comments about their business using Brand24, an AI social media monitoring platform. Along with monitoring brand reputation, it also enables us to evaluate marketing initiatives and deal with any problems before they go out of hand.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Surfer SEO</h3>



<p>SEO Surfer is an AI online tool for optimising blog posts, articles, and other content pieces. It is designed for managing technical SEO. Moreover, it has the ability to analyse content using over 500 ranking criteria and can assess keywords using Google&#8217;s BERT approach.</p>



<p>And the list goes on.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Impact of AI on Marketing&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Every news channel, every social media platform, and almost all the content creators on the internet are talking about AI since the launch of ChatGPT. Some are talking about its pros and cons, some have made a business out of it and others have completely disregarded its use. No doubt, AI has entered all industries and the marketing industry is no less. But is it safe to say that AI will take over all jobs in the near future?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CEO of the 123Internet, a Digital Marketing Agency, said <em>“We’ve been using AI tools for a while now, in particular automatically checking website designs in hundreds of screen and browser types, this speeds up our design and development process.”</em></p>



<p>This is a perfect example to reflect that AI has touched marketing to its roots. It is also suspected that it will be able to detect at which stage the customer is stuck on the marketing funnel in the near future. </p>



<p>With the increase in the appetite for online content, social media, and online advertising, AI has all the more reason to intervene. Presently, it is offering a hand by automating and scheduling content. Ever since the launch of ChatGPT, AI can even generate content ideas along with a well-structured piece of content.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can Marketers Leverage AI?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>After the launch of free ChatGPT, Sundar Pichai declared code red within the company. It has definitely threatened jobs but will it overtake the charge soon and create large-scale unemployment worldwide? Or will we adapt to it? Let’s find out!&nbsp;</p>



<p>The world was stunned when OpenAI launched DALL-E 2 which could produce phenomenal graphics with a small text input. This revolutionised the landscape of the graphic design industry. Other tools like Stable Diffusion and Midjourney also do the same. Does it call for no human input? Indeed, not! However much, AI has evolved, but it still lacks empathy and complex feelings. Studies also say that since these technologies are created by humans, they might be biased. And that’s where businesses can leverage it. </p>



<p>Ever since the launch of ChatGPT, Google has been trying to create a more competitive model. Hence, there are rising clues that it will launch a “text-to-video AI model”. Additionally, OpenAI has already announced GPT-4 which is based on multimodal capabilities and will be able to simultaneously operate across images, texts, and audio. This will help in creating new business models at a much faster rate. The AI new tool will give businesses a rough blueprint that they can tweak as per their need, consumer behaviour, and the latest industry trends.  </p>



<p>Another awaited AI is Generative AI. Among this newly introduced niche, AI Generative Music is the most popular. It will establish itself as a standard in commercial jingles, background music for videos, and other media that could also contribute to this growth in marketing. Moreover, generative imagery has the potential to assist in producing high-quality pictures for social media posts, logos, and other purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Natural Language Processing already enables AI-powered digital assistants and chatbots to have human-like conversations, respond to ever-sophisticated queries, and tailor interactions based on user intent. Companies soon will be able to provide clients with personalised experiences and solutions. AI can be used to predict consumer wants and expectations more accurately using specific client data which would speed up handling and assist in spotting emerging trends.</p>



<p>Similarly, other sectors can do the following to make the most of it:</p>



<ul><li>Identify the Areas of Business That Can Gain Most Advantage</li><li>Make Sure that You Have a Strong Strategy and Advanced Data Set</li><li>Leverage Data to Accelerate the Decision Making Process</li><li>Automate Tasks</li><li>Find Processes which are most Consistent and Repeatable&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is Marketing Possible without Humans?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As more and more studies surface on the internet, it is highly plausible that AI will replace humans in the future. And perhaps in some corner of the world, some brilliant engineer might have achieved what we believe will come to life 10 years from now. Take ChatGPT as an example, it spread like wildfire and so far it has the fastest-growing consumer base. One fine evening, you are generating ideas and the next day OpenAI launched this technology. Wouldn’t you feel threatened?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, it might be a story for some other day. But this debate will go on until one day we see AI taking over humans.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are two buzzwords these days. People frequently use the terms interchangeably when referring to intelligent software or systems.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that they are both based on statistics and mathematics, AI and machine learning are not the same.</p>



<p>In this post, you&#8217;ll learn the differences between AI and machine learning, as well as some practical examples to help you understand them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is AI, or Artificial Intelligence?</strong></h2>



<p>The ability of a computer or machine to copy or reproduce human intelligent behavior and accomplish human-like activities is known as artificial intelligence or AI.</p>



<p>Artificial intelligence can think, reason, learn from experience, and, most crucially, make its own judgments, all of which require human intelligence.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>&#8220;Artificial intelligence (AI) is the science and engineering of creating intelligent machines.&#8221; — McCarthy, John</strong></p></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Picture-1-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8983"/></figure>



<p>Artificial intelligence can do a lot of things, but it hasn&#8217;t yet mastered the capacity to communicate with people on an emotional level.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s look at some examples of artificial intelligence in action to learn more about it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Personal Assistants</strong></h3>



<p>Personal assistant tools, which are Human-AI interaction gadgets, are another kind of AI. Google Home, Apple&#8217;s Siri, Amazon&#8217;s Alexa, and Microsoft&#8217;s Cortana are the most popular personal assistants.</p>



<p>Users can use these personal assistants to look up information, book hotels, add events to calendars, answer queries, plan meetings, and send messages or emails, among other things.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Robotics</strong></h3>



<p>A good example of AI is an industrial robot. To avoid costly downtime, industrial robots can check their own accuracy and performance and sense or detect when the repair is required. It can also act in a new or unfamiliar setting.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is ML, or Machine Learning?</strong></h2>



<p>Machine learning, or ML, is a subset of artificial intelligence that can learn from data without being explicitly programmed or aided by domain knowledge.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In machine learning, learning refers to a machine&#8217;s ability to learn from data, as well as an ML algorithm&#8217;s ability to train a model, assess its performance or accuracy, and then generate predictions.</p></blockquote>



<p>For example, supervised machine learning techniques like Random Forest and Decision Trees can be used to train a system.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8982"/></figure>



<p>The goal of machine learning is to allow machines to learn from their own data and make accurate predictions.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s look at some Machine Learning examples to learn more.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Email Spam and Malware Filtering</strong></h3>



<p>Spam (unwanted commercial bulk email) has become a major issue for internet users. Machine learning algorithms are being used by the majority of email service providers to automatically learn and identify spam emails and phishing messages.</p>



<p>Gmail and Yahoo mail spam filters, for example, do more than just looking for spam emails based on pre-defined algorithms. As they continue their spam filtering activities, they build new rules based on what they&#8217;ve learned.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Product Recommendations</strong></h3>



<p>Machine learning tools are available on most e-commerce platforms, and they provide product recommendations based on previous data.</p>



<p>For example, if you search for machine learning books on Amazon and then purchase one when you return after a set length of time, Amazon&#8217;s home page will display a list of machine learning books.</p>



<p>It also provides suggestions based on what you&#8217;ve liked, what you&#8217;ve placed to your cart and other similar actions.</p>



<p><strong>Related Topic:</strong> <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/scope-of-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-in-india/">Scope Of Artificial Intelligence And Machine Learning In India</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The major difference between AI and ML are:</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</strong></td><td><strong>MACHINE LEARNING</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Artificial intelligence (AI) is described as the ability to learn and apply knowledge, while intelligence is defined as the acquisition of knowledge.</td><td>Machine Learning (ML) is described as the acquisition of knowledge or expertise by a computer.</td></tr><tr><td>The goal is to enhance the likelihood of success rather than accuracy.</td><td>Its goal is to improve accuracy, but it is unconcerned about success.</td></tr><tr><td>It functions like a computer program that performs intelligent tasks.</td><td>It&#8217;s a simple concept: a machine gathers information and learns from it.</td></tr><tr><td>The idea is to create a computer model of natural intelligence that can solve complex problems.</td><td>The idea is to learn from data on a specific task in order to maximize the machine&#8217;s performance on that task.</td></tr><tr><td>AI is decision-making.</td><td>Machine learning (ML) is a technique that allows a computer system to learn new things from data.</td></tr><tr><td>It leads to the creation of a system that can imitate human behavior in a certain context.</td><td>It entails the development of self-learning algorithms.</td></tr><tr><td>AI will go for finding the optimal solution.</td><td>ML will choose the best answer regardless of whether it is optimal.</td></tr><tr><td>AI leads to intelligence or wisdom.</td><td>ML leads to knowledge.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h2>



<p>To summarise, AI is a subset of artificial intelligence that solves specific tasks by learning from data and generating predictions, whereas ML is a subset of artificial intelligence that solves problems that require human intellect.</p>



<p>This indicates that every AI is machine learning, but not all machine learning is AI.</p>

AI enables a PC structure to choose conjectures or take a couple of decisions using chronicled data without being unequivocally altered. It uses an enormous proportion of coordinated and semi-coordinated data so an AI model can create a definite result or give gauges subject to that data. AI works on estimation which learns all alone using chronicled data. It ends up only for express regions, for instance, on the off chance that we are making an AI model distinguish pictures of canines, it will simply give results for canine pictures, yet if we give another data like cat picture, it will become lazy. AI is being used in better places, for instance, for online recommender structure, for Google search computations, Email spam channels, Facebook Auto buddy marking thought, etc&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are a privileged generation to live in this era full of technological advancements. Gone are the days when almost everything was done manually, and now we live in the time where a lot of work is taken over by machines, software, and various automatic processes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before having an insight into what are the benefits of pursuing an <strong><em>M.Sc. in AI and ML from NMIMS</em></strong>, it is very important for you to have an understanding of what exactly AI and ML is and why you should go for it, or what are the future benefits of AI and ML which can help you foster your career growth. So let&#8217;s start with getting a very basic understanding of what AI and ML is.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</strong></h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><em>Intelligence: “Ability to learn, understand and think”</em></strong></p></blockquote>



<p>Artificial intelligence or AI is nothing but the science of computers and machines developing intelligence like humans. In this technology, the machines are able to do some of the simple to complex stuff that humans need to do on a regular basis. John McCarthy coined the term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ in the 1950s. He said, ‘Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions, and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.’</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Machine Learning (ML)?</strong></h2>



<p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). Machine learning algorithms allow AI to not only process that data, but to use it to learn and get smarter, without needing any additional programming.&nbsp;With increased data and experience, the results of machine learning are more accurate—much like how humans improve with more practice.</p>



<p>The adaptability of machine learning makes it a great choice in scenarios where the data is always changing, the nature of the request or task is always shifting, or coding a solution would be effectively impossible.</p>
