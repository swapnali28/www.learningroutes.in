										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you are 30+ years old, graduated, and have good work experience, and you are thinking of doing a<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/nmims-distance-mba/"><strong>distance MBA course</strong></a> to enhance your value, knowledge, and your career growth, then let&#8217;s dig in.</p>



<p>This article will give you all the relevant details you require before enrolling in an MBA course after 30 plus of age.</p>



<p>As it is said-Age can never be a hurdle in the way of an individual who really wants to learn and upgrade his skill set, you can get enrolled into a Master of Business Administration program without giving much importance to your age.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Y7t6hyQvwDqgRRe1m82R_0dAsoGVSDeh7KhmO-eH5QQVWWgsndU-fr4oe1Od_HHt2nhOpebe3eBv5thRbp9bQ36Drfd90V9cRlz4tG398i7uL-EjINLr0VL7U0545nSj_xpTlsWABhBLx-exIu4" alt=""/></figure>



<p>It is very much understandable that there must be some reasons why you couldn’t pursue your master&#8217;s at an earlier age. Maybe you were unaware of the advantages of the course or maybe you were having a lack of interest. Some of you may have attempted to be admitted to one such program but were unsuccessful due to your CAT score, or you may already be an MBA! So, now when you are planning to pursue your dream, there might be a lot of questions and doubts running through your mind. This article will try to answer all your queries and will sort you by the end.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before we proceed further, have a look at a table which gives information about the Top B-schools in the world and the average age of students.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>B-School</td><td>Average Age(in years)</td><td>Average Work Ex(in years)</td></tr><tr><td>Stanford Graduate School Of Business (Us)</td><td>27&nbsp;</td><td>4&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Wharton School Of The University Of Pennsylvania (Us)</td><td>28</td><td>5&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp; Harvard Business School (Us)</td><td>27&nbsp;</td><td>4.2&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp; University Of Rotman (Canada)</td><td>27&nbsp;</td><td>4.3&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp; Western University Ivey (Canada)</td><td>28&nbsp;</td><td>4.8&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp; London Business School (Uk)</td><td>29&nbsp;</td><td>5&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp; Instead ( France And Singapore)</td><td>29&nbsp;</td><td>6&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp; Lese Business School (Spain)</td><td>28</td><td>4&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp; Esade Business School (Spain)</td><td>29&nbsp;</td><td>5&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp; Hec Paris (France)</td><td>30&nbsp;</td><td>5.8&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp; Warwick Business School (Uk)</td><td>32&nbsp;</td><td>9&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp; Imd (Switzerland)</td><td>31&nbsp;</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp; NUS (Singapore)</td><td>32</td><td>7&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp; ISB (India)</td><td>27</td><td>4.2&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp; Lim – A Pgpx (India)</td><td>32</td><td>9&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>It is very evident from the given data that the average age of students who are studying in the significant B-schools ranges from 27-32 which means that people doing MBA after crossing 30 is a common thing.</p>



<p>First, let us know about the advantages of doing Master of Business Administration after 30</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Expansion In knowledge &#8211; Helps you handle your promotions better&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>A person who is thinking of doing an MBA in his 30s must be having years of experience and expertise with a lot of practical knowledge which means you already have the skills and all you need to know is some thesis. Doing it will provide an addition to your theoretical knowledge which may benefit you once you are promoted to managerial positions. From a person who is in a managerial level position, it is never expected that he should do any calculation or perform the daily tasks. As the manager should ideally serve the purpose of an effective leader, all he has to do is to handle his team well and get maximum output of them.</p>



<p>The program will teach you all these skills and will also teach you how you can apply them effectively to the people working under you.</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Salary Increment-Increase your value&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>There is no doubt that adding a degree combined with years of experience and expertise to your resume will bring you more job opportunities and increased wages. Any candidate is hired on the basis of his skills and knowledge and finishing your MBA makes you a complete package of all the qualities required in a perfect employee. Doing the course will increase your annual package by approximately 2-3L.</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Evolution-A different frame of mind&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Being a self-aware person and working on self-growth, having good interpersonal skills are part of the qualities required for being a leader and or manager at any level.</p>



<p>Maybe, the decision of not doing an MBA course at the right time was taken by you because you did not want to invest in self-growth but now when you have realized the value of personal improvement, taking up this program will help you a lot.</p>



<p>The course will provide you with time to give yourself and also you can use this opportunity to be more attentive about your own self. You might also utilize this period to rediscover who you are and can pursue any more interests or hobbies in the future.</p>



<p>You get the chance to take online classes alongside other people who are studying the same subject as you. A decent<a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/nmims-distance-mba/"> distance MBA</a> provider institute will make sure that you stay in touch with the other students who are doing the same course. Such interactions will help to increase your personal growth apart from your job description. If you are taking any learning program from<strong> NMIMS,</strong> they will provide you with a free portal where you can easily get in touch with your fellow apprentices.</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Build Connections- Better job Opportunities&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>After crossing a certain age and acquiring relevant experience, you must know that the time is gone when you will be able to get jobs through online portals. Why is that? Because now you are not looking for junior or executive positions, you are aiming for head or managerial positions which are usually filled based on networks and connectivity.</p>



<p>Doing the Masters&#8217;s program in Business Administration will help you with expanding your network and hence your net worth.</p>



<p>Not only this, but you can also do so by taking up a course that is providing you education by sitting in the comfort of your home. You can enrol in an <strong>Online MBA course by NMIMS</strong> and can simultaneously do your job and study.</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to get enrolled?</strong></h3>



<ul><li>Go to the University website. You will easily get all the details here.</li><li>Have an overview of the courses provided.&nbsp;</li><li>Fill in your details in the Enquiry section and you will be connected to an expert who will guide you regarding all the necessary details.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With the advent of globalization, professions have taken a toll. Distance education is accepted worldwide like never before. Along with that professional courses like MBA and Engineering programs, both at the graduate, undergraduate levels and other skill-based courses are more sought-after in India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reports suggest that distance MBA enrollment is increasing exponentially and many top private and government universities have inculcated online and distance learning in their education system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to reports, <strong>26% of females and 74% of males pursue MBA / PGP and they come from all backgrounds and education streams.</strong> Institutes like Narsee Monjee Institute of Management, Amity University, Chandigarh University, and many others are shaping India&#8217;s distance higher education sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Narsee Monjee Institute of Management is among the top 10 Business Schools in India. The institute is accredited nationally and internationally by UGC, and WES and is also endorsed by NAAC with an “A+” Grade. NIRF has also ranked the institute in 22nd position among the top institutes in India.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How many specializations are offered in the </strong><a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/nmims-ngasce/"><strong>NMIMS Global distance MBA course</strong></a><strong>?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>NMIMS has thoughtfully crafted its course for working professionals as well as for freshers under a reasonable fee structure. Their distance MBA course includes <strong>10 industry-oriented specializations</strong>, namely:</p>



<ol><li>Business Management</li><li>Marketing Management</li><li>Financial Management</li><li>Human Resource Management</li><li>International Trade Management</li><li>Banking and Finance Management</li><li>Supply Chain Management</li><li>Operations Management</li><li>Retail Management</li><li>Information Technology and Systems Management</li></ol>



<p>Since Narsee Monjee Institute of Management have also gained <strong>Category-1 Autonomy</strong> by UGC hence they can tweak their curriculum and update it according to the industry.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>NMIMS procedure to opt for a specialization&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Narsee Monjee Global distance offers 10 specializations and the students can choose from any one of them irrespective of their background.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the students are taking admission in their distance course the institute encourages them to opt for specialization so the portal they create can be tweaked according to that area of expertise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eg &#8211; if a student selects for Human Resource Management, he will have to mention the specialization while filling the admission form. The student portal is created according to that. Previous year&#8217;s question papers, e-books, and other student material catering to Human Resource Management will be added to it.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>NMIMS procedure to change the specialization</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>There are two circumstances under which the students can change their specializations.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Situation 1: &#8211;</strong>&nbsp;<br>Students can change their specializations between the submission for the admission fee and the course fee. In this situation, there will be no extra payment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Situation 2: &#8211;&nbsp;</strong><br>Students’ can change their specialization after the submission of the tuition fees. This is a chargeable procedure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the 1st year, students will have to study all the subjects and from the 2nd year, students will begin their specialized course. Although the students can change their specializations until 6 to 8 months of course with a reasonable payable amount after the beginning of the 2nd year, students can not opt for a switch.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3 basic tips and tricks you can follow to choose your specialization</strong></h2>



<p>Choosing a specialization seems like a herculean task because MBA, in general, is a sought-after practical course and all the specializations almost equally yield a similar Return on Investment (ROI).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are 3 easy tips via which you can easily pick your course: &#8211;&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>For the 1st year, the students are taught general courses. Based on which subject they like the most, they can opt for it. This helps in making a rational decision based on personal experience.&nbsp;</li><li>Students can pre-decide before enrolling in the course based on industry research and the knowledge of the market as well as statistical data.&nbsp;</li><li>Passion and interest are parameters among other things.&nbsp;</li></ol>

<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Which MBA should you choose for the NMIMS distance course?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>As we have described 3 former checkpoints to picking a course, let’s niche down a little more according to the course curriculum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the most popular MBA specialities among students is the <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/distance-mba-financial-management/">MBA in Finance.</a> The finance domain prepares you to analyze business financial performance, comprehend economic trends, undertake due diligence, and make investment decisions for the organization. This is a highly competitive and quantitative field due to high-paying jobs. </p>



<p>Students who choose to specialize in finance in their MBA program will study topics including Cost &amp; Management Accounting, Taxation, Capital Market and Portfolio Management, Corporate Finance, and International Finance among other critical subject matters in the domain.ICIC Bank, HDFC Bank, American Express, Accenture, TATA, JP Morgan, and other corporates are among the organizations that hire MBA graduates with a focus on finance.</p>



<p>An MBA in Operations is very useful for professionals because operations are the foundation of any organization. For both manufacturing and service companies, you will learn how to maximize corporate resources, create process flows, plan production, construct supply chains and logistics, manage suppliers, monitor quality control, and achieve continual operational efficiency improvement. Since operations specialists serve as the centre of a business, these positions also determine managerial and leadership skills, which an MBA helps students acquire.</p>



<p>Operations management, service and production planning, inventory management, supply chain management, and quality management are just a few of the topics covered in an MBA with a speciality in operations.</p>



<p>Marketing Management is yet another popular specialization, with the rise in social media and digitization students prefer to opt for it and the market demand has also risen with time. Marketing included both analytical and creative capabilities giving the students a holistic platform to showcase their skills. Not only the course is based on hard core course-based skills or theories but soft skills are an important parameter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some other specializations in NMIMS distance courses are also preferred by the students such as International Trade which helps the students to understand foreign relations better and how they can build their careers abroad. Another expert course is Information Technology and Systems Management which is generally preferred by Engineering and Science students given that they already have a background in it.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Current Packages in India in the NMIMS’s former specializations</strong></h2>



<p>Students are generally worried if they will get equal placement assistance as is offered to regular students. Well, this is <strong>NMIMS Global distance MBA’s USP</strong> that they offer the same opportunities to all their students despite the mode of the course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NMIMS offers free “Alumni Portal’ and “Career Development Services” for the students in their distance courses where they can expand their network, connect with the right people and find jobs.</p>

<p>According to Technavio, the pool of MBA graduates will see an increment of USD 2.28 billion between the years 2021 and 2025 in India. Over the last few years, online degrees have seen more acceptance due to various advantages that they bring along.</p>



<p>In the year 2021, Nirmala Sitharaman, Finance Minister of India announced that top universities and institutes listed under NIRF will offer online courses and this announcement led to a gateway of opportunities, especially for the working professionals. After this declaration by the finance minister, a huge wave of students enrolled in online courses and thus contributing to the economy and their careers.</p>



<div style="height:14px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the advantages of an online MBA?</strong></h3>



<p>As reported by Renub Research, the e-learning industry will observe a drastic increment by the year 2026. In numbers, the industry will be USD $8.6 billion large.</p>



<p>Universities are leveraging this industry and making big money out of it but it’s a win-win for both sides; students as well universities. Following are some advantages of online MBA courses: &#8211;</p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Acceptance</h4>



<p>The last few years have increased enrolment rates in online MBA courses and these numbers increased since March 2020 as soon as COVID-19 hit the economy. During that time, e-learning platforms saved the providence of India. As reported by News 18, Shafi Vikraman, a man from Thiruvananthapuram utilized his time effectively and completed 145 online certificate courses not only from India but from the Ivy League Universities. The man has set an example for all the people who lacked confidence in online courses.</p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Opportunity to multitask</h4>



<p>Universities like Narsee Monjee Institute of Management gives the opportunity to work and simultaneously do their online MBA course. There are many other universities that have the same criteria for example &#8211; Amity University, Chandigarh University, Dr, DY Patil University, etc.</p>



<p>Online MBA courses are thoughtfully crafted for the working professional so that they can execute their knowledge in their current job and as a long-term goal they can apply for better high-package jobs or get a promotion in their current company.</p>



<div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Online courses have more reach</h4>



<p>Online courses have more reach than regular courses. For regular courses, the students have to relocate to a specific location and look for suitable accommodation that proves to be heavy on the pocket. On the other hand, <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/nmims-distance-mba/">online MBA courses</a> can be opted from anywhere anytime. In addition, these online courses are industry-aligned and focus on helping students gain the most in-demand skills. Not to forget, the career advancement services and placements do come along as a major hallmark of the online courses.</p>



<p>Online courses are also not restricted to only high-scoring students because they offer opportunities to others and also value the work experience gained by them.</p>



<div style="height:14px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>ROI of online MBA</strong></h3>



<p>Despite the factors listed above and well known to all, there is still a lack of confidence in online MBA courses. Hence here are some facts and figures that will make you believe its importance.</p>



<p>The ROI of an online MBA degree can vary on various factors, such as: &#8211;</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Specialization</li><li>Graduating University</li><li>Placement and Networking assistance etc.</li></ol>



<p>The investment in online MBA colleges varies from where you do your course, for example &#8211; you have to invest 1.40 Lakh to take admission in Narsee Monjee Institute of Management but you have to invest INR 58,000 to take admission in IGNOU online MBA. But NMIMS also offers career assistance, interview preparation, and an Alumni portal for the students. Similarly, other universities have different USPs, and it should be an integral factor to look into while choosing a course. Although there are subjective factors that come into play for instance &#8211; interview, and exam which depends entirely on the student. Despite that Glassdoor has suggested that the average package of a beginner who opts for an online MBA degree can be approximately 3.60 Lakhs per annum.</p>



<p>Reports have also suggested that the salaries can also vary with specializations. According to Career 360, the average salary of a Sales Manager is INR 5.00 lakhs, a Brand Manager earns INR 9.00 lakhs on an average and a Marketing Manager has an earning potential of INR 6.50 lakhs. These are a few listed salaries but the opportunities after pursuing an online MBA are limitless.</p>



<p>Other aspects to take into consideration are placement opportunities and accreditations. Often, students tend to miss out on this information. If you are opting for an online course and your university is not accredited then your time, energy and investment can fall flat to their face.</p>



<p>World recognized brands and companies are keen to offer jobs to students who pursue their MBA via online mode because they also have previous work experience which helps the companies onboard new and fresh talent. Top recruiters of online MBA are &#8211; Microsoft, Google, Adobe, Infosys, Wipro, Amazon, Flipkart, Nestle, etc.</p>



<div style="height:14px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>University Recommendations</strong></h3>



<p>Most universities in India have initiated offering online and distance MBA courses. Among the top are: &#8211;</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Narsee Monjee Institute of Management</li><li>IMT Ghaziabad</li><li>Dr. DY Patil University</li><li>Chandigarh University</li><li>Amity University</li></ol>



<p>These universities are in popular demand among the students. They are also accredited by national and international bodies that prove their authority in the domain.</p>



<div style="height:14px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Online MBA: an Overview</strong></h3>



<p>According to Hayden Noel, a professor from Gies College of Business; “The training you receive in an MBA Program prepares you to deal with ambiguity and provides a buffer against uncertainty. You would be better equipped to take advantage of changing opportunities post-COVID. You will also become more effective as a leader and better understand the different functions of your organization.”</p>



<p>India is ranked 2nd for e-learning after the US. Students and hiring companies have also acknowledged these degrees. As much as regular courses are popular, in a certain way they cannot beat online courses because they require a huge investment of money and time. The only factor while choosing your online MBA courses should be a good and in-depth analysis of the university from where you will pursue your degree and their career assistance opportunities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>NMIMS is one of the top management institutes in the country. The quality curriculum significantly helps students to acquire the most in-demand skills thereby helping them elevate their respective career paths.

<p>Primarily, the two-year NMIMS Distance MBA ( ODL mode) offers a deeper understanding of the various functions and principles of marketing, which can be practically applied in the corporate world. The course of Masters in Business Administration significantly helps students to gain knowledge of the marketing principles and apply them in their job processes to deliver effectively and efficiently. For this reason, a Master in Business Administration (MBA) is one of the most popular degrees among students who want to pursue a career in the field of marketing.</p>



<p>It is also equally important to mention that one of the particular reasons behind the popularity of MBA Marketing is the learning experience and salary growth that it provides. MBA in Marketing provides you with a wide range of avenues to grow your career horizon. During the entire duration of the program, you will garner your analytical thinking and presentation skills.</p>



<p>With coursework projects and assignments, you will develop interpersonal and problem-solving skills. Furthermore, working on tight deadlines will prepare you for the workplace environment.</p>



<p>A two-year program (MBA) that facilitates specialization in marketing, finance, and human resources management and the fact that the demand for an MBA (Marketing) has seen a steep increase in the past few years due to its huge career prospects.</p>



<p>Most importantly during an MBA course, a student gets exposure to what’s precisely happening and is demanded in the outside world. A student is given the opportunity to interact closely with industry experts who share their vast practical experience. In this regard, it is often seen that an industry expert also acts as a mentor for the students guiding them through the important frameworks of different sectors.</p>



<p>Now, when considering an MBA (or distance MBA) the question arises which are the best universities in India that have the most comprehensive and meticulous management programs. NMIMS University, without a doubt, comes to the top of our lists considering the fact that their business school is considered among top-tier institutes in India. Along with providing career advancement services, their syllabus and curriculum are aligned to help students develop skills in them.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Notably, and in detail, an NMIMS MBA India helps students in the following significant ways –</strong></h4>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Get a Competitive Advantage</strong></h5>



<p>Besides having technical knowledge, managerial skills are much more pertinent to growing in a career. The knowledge gained through a comprehensive degree program MBA places a candidate in a position to take strategic decisions and helps the organization to grow.</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Earn a Higher Salary</strong></h5>



<p>With the responsibility of taking strategic decisions, a higher salary is one of the perks that come with having an MBA. Thus, it is one of the right and important decisions to pursue an MBA.</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Leadership Role</strong></h5>



<p>Each individual aspires to take a leadership role at some stage of their career. However, a candidate with an MBA always stands a higher chance of being given such an assignment considering the fact that the degree brings analytical and various other essential skills.</p>



<p>There is a varied range of subjects that students get to study during the NMIMS Distance MBA in the marketing program. However, it is important to note that a student who has an MBA degree is preferred to be given a promotion as it’s a safe bet and understandably in the organization’s favor to give an opportunity to someone who has acquired managerial skills through academic pursuit.</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Career Advancement Opportunities</strong></h5>



<p>An MBA (Marketing) helps you get a job promotion and prepares you for management and executive positions.</p>



<p>This postgraduate program equips you with the required leadership and communication skills so you can grab the top marketing jobs with ease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The program of MBA (Marketing) mainly enhances your business development, advertising, and marketing skills. It also helps one’s interpersonal skills and get into the mind of the consumer.</p>



<p>These are some of the skills required for a senior-level position. Furthermore, with technological augmentation, marketing becomes the heart of any organization, creating an innovative marketing job profile mix.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exploring Varied Avenues</strong></h5>



<p>In a leadership role, a person is not only in the position to take strategic decisions with authority given but also gets to work closely in different segments and newer avenues. For example,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Management programs are popularly known for helping individuals elevate their career paths. However, not everybody has the privilege to resign from their jobs and take up full-time management programs. In this regard, the question that so often arises in the minds of the people is, is an online/ distance MBA equivalent or as valued as an offline post-graduate management program. The answer to this is quite simple. In the current times, wherein norms are being redefined, the acceptability of an online and distance MBA is wide and overwhelming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having said that, once candidates are wholly convinced that online and distance MBA options are as good, they might feel that both are the same things/courses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hence, to begin with, an online MBA can be explained as an improvised and better version of a distance MBA. It can also be said that it is basically like the evolution of a distance MBA for even wider acceptability and better upskilling of students through an industry-aligned curriculum that facilitates interaction between students and teachers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, distance learning is individual-based learning. While this course gives you the freedom to join an MBA program anywhere in the world, candidates must handle most parts of the course on their own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The students enrolling in distance education programs in India are given the books and syllabus and then they are all on their own to learn and acquire knowledge and information. Incurably, a distance MBA is not much interaction-based. The study material is sent by post. Although the course materials are articulated and designed in a way that they can be easily comprehended, student dedication plays a critical role.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Institutes/Universities which offer distance learning usually have their centers in different cities. One goes to these exam centers and writes their final examination.</p>



<p>The centers established in varied cities are mostly established for administrative reasons but on rare occasions, the students are called a few times to interact with the experts. If a student is a disciplined self-learner, this course can be helpful to a certain extent. Since there is not much technology involved, it is quite pocket friendly. Nonetheless, the biggest concern is that many students get demotivated and get bored because of having to learn in their shells. This being one of the biggest limitations of the distance MBA programs, many would not want to take it up for lack of peer learning avenues, etc.</p>



<p>Now, moving to a wholesome discussion about what an online MBA is. It is mainly technology and internet-based learning of management subjects. The best online business schools from IIMs to XLRI, Narsee Monjee (NMIMS), and Symbiosis offer virtual classes where you can interact with the experts of the subject and also with your fellow students. Thus, this course not only appears to be interesting and interactive but also helps in building networks. This course is beneficial in terms of that it can be reached anytime/anywhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The curriculum is aligned with industry demand with the principal focus being on helping students acquire the most in-demand market skills. Thus, it offers complete freedom. Hard copies of the course contents are provided by the online schools but there is no need to wait for them. The books and course material can be downloaded on the machine. Virtual classes also allow discussion, skills practice, lecture, or project discussions. This eliminates the chances of getting bored or demotivated.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Henceforward, we are attaching a tabular differentiation, particularly between an MBA that can be done through online Mode and Distance MBA in India.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Basis</td><td>Online MBA</td><td>Distance MBA</td></tr><tr><td>Accessibility</td><td>Access to PC and Internet is important to get through the course of the program</td><td>Study material is delivered at the address of the candidate.</td></tr><tr><td>Eligibility</td><td>Bachelor’s degree with a minimum score of 50%</td><td>Graduation from a recognized university</td></tr><tr><td>Attendance Requirement</td><td>Required as per the case</td><td>Not required</td></tr><tr><td>Student Teacher Interaction</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Assignments</td><td>To be submitted through online mode.</td><td>To be completed and submitted to the respective study centers</td></tr><tr><td>Placement Assistance</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Alumni Status</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Average Package</td><td>8.25 lacs approximately</td><td>6.50 lacs approximately</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Most importantly, an MBA that is done through online mode helps the students interact with each other and also learn under the guidance of an industry expert. Furthermore, unlike a distance MBA, the former brings students newer job opportunities in terms of placements, etc. NMIMS – one of the most renowned business schools in India is gaining mass popularity for its quality online management (MBA to be precise) programs which are widely being taken up by working professionals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With all said and done, the primary focus of candidates who are exploring management programs to elevate their careers must consider their core requirements to choosing between the various modes of management programs. Of course, if they feel that peer learning and having an expert for more insights and meticulous knowledge is important to them, an MBA via online mode should be their go-to option. But in case the candidate feels that technology isn’t the right medium for that and they can individually learn better at their pace, a distance MBA can well be a good option for them.</p>



<p>Now all you need to do is to understand your requirements. Also, check out the availability of the technology for yourself and then get enrolled in either distance MBA or MBA via online mode.</p>
