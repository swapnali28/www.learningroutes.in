<p>With the ever-changing job market, you need to be proactive about how to prepare for a job, look for new opportunities and stay updated with the latest market trends. All this helps you to stay competitive and gives your career an edge. This is where education plays a crucial role. <strong>According to Forbes, the following graph represents the hourly wages vs education of students between 1979 and 2001. </strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qD3h-VodSKHrOx5xMVSn6m3ce1RttgUJChUgEfN75O9sBxqa2ojKY-xvfuZhC-pn6nto-O6I8aVIfEWmSrmPJVehK620CC60z0sf_16v4-so_ReYUVgyWREk6m0JDH75dzM3Df_oybIckPK9dWEz9LTC8W71evNUWokLxKHRnB1ULuLKPk-o5QtTyaC1-g" alt=""/></figure>



<p>So what will the jobs be like in the coming years? What is the necessity for preparation for a job? And how to prepare for jobs in order to get the right job that suits your interest? Let&#8217;s dive deep into the scenario of the job market. </p>



<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the Scenario of the Job Market in 2023?</strong></h3>



<p>The job market is bound to change constantly due to the changing needs and technology in the world and thus, it becomes difficult to figure out how to prepare for a job at the right time. There was a tremendous change in the job market during and post-pandemic as there were a great number of layoffs, shortage of jobs, and an increased unemployment rate. But the post-pandemic era also lured us with newer jobs and changing work trends like working from home was the “new normal” and till date many companies encourage it. But as we are reaching the end of 2022, what will be the scenario of jobs in 2023?</p>



<p><strong>As of 2022, many new employment opportunities in the IT, real estate and health sectors are seen with the IT sector leading the race. FY2022 recorded a 15.5% growth which was the highest ever, reaching USD 270 billion in revenue. It is also seen as a year of tech startups. </strong>A trend that will definitely see a significant boost in 2023 is a shift from theoretical knowledge to a focus on soft skills. An employer would likely hire somebody who can crack that code, build a strong strategy or create amazing graphics. Employers will tend to seek employees who have strong communication skills, problem-solving abilities and team-building abilities because these qualities reflect adaptability and flexibility in an ever-changing workplace. </p>



<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5 Tips to Become Job Ready in the Changing Job Market:</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Understanding the Current Job Market and Trends</strong></h4>



<p>Since the job market is bound to evolve with changing times, it becomes crucial to stay up-to-date with the changing trends. Hence, research plays a very important role when it comes to understanding the job market. For instance, it helps to understand which trend might last more than 10 years. One such example is:  post-pandemic people started preferring remote or work from home and this trend is likely to persist in the coming years. There are even more diverse modes of work emerging such as freelancing, contract projects and much more. Many people are finding self-employment to be a better option than working from the office. It, therefore, becomes obvious that the current job market demands you to be flexible at work and tech-savvy. </p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Explore Newly Evolving Fields</strong></h4>



<p>India has a mixed economy which makes it an attractive country for many diverse job sectors. But, it was seen that India’s economy was sick before the coronavirus crisis and it went even more down during the pandemic. The pandemic also brought about the scenario of online systems and the boost in sectors like digital marketing which is evolving drastically and thereby is creating newer job opportunities. Along with that, technology-driven job profiles are also expected to see a boost. According to Business Standards, “Two-thirds<strong> of Indian knowledge workers are likely to switch jobs in 2023.” </strong>Additionally, studies have also shown that Indian<strong> gaming will add up to 1 lakh jobs in the year 2023. </strong></p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Opt for Industry-Oriented Courses</strong></h4>



<p>Having a good education isn’t enough to get a dream job with a good salary package, you need the right blend of education with soft skills and other professional abilities to face the competitive world. One of the best degrees that can help you land better jobs is management and technical degrees like Btech, MBA, professional diplomas and many others which help you to enhance your career opportunities, and get higher salary packages and job promotions. </p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. <strong>Grow Your Skills</strong></h4>



<p>You need to grow and learn new skills to be updated with the ongoing changes. You cannot rely on a present job for your entire life as the industry keeps bringing in new job demands and skill sets. You should grow in those skills which are of your interest be it animation, writing, painting, etc. Today, there are a number of free as well as paid courses available to learn and develop new skills in any field. Growing your skills can help in switching careers or changing a field and also help to generate additional income. You can be more creative and stay active in this process of acquiring new skills. </p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. <strong>Gain Experience</strong></h4>



<p>Employers would definitely prefer to hire an experienced person but that does not mean that freshers can never land a job. Students, generally, opt for internships during their college education which helps them to hone their skills and understand the nuances of the industry. Additionally, this also helps the students to expand their network which can assist them to land their dream job in future.&nbsp;</p>

<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<p>Studies have shown that at least one project management office is hired in 89% of firms, and about 50% of firms have multiple PMOs. This further demonstrates how project managers greatly benefit an organisation by ensuring that all resources are used in the most effective manner. A project manager&#8217;s function involves a variety of skills, including managing people, resolving technical issues, exercising leadership, and planning. With the new hybrid or work from home models which are in effect post-pandemic, the necessity for project managers will only increase. </p>

With the rising popularity of cryptocurrency and the advent of Metaverse, the field will only continue to grow.</p>



<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Takeaway</strong></h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A business development executive is a valuable addition to any company. A skilled BDE can bring in new business and boost a company&#8217;s prospects. A BDE&#8217;s main responsibility is to generate leads for companies in e-commerce, retail, pharma, FMCG, electronics, clothes and fashion, cosmetics, furniture, aerospace, manufacturing, chemicals, and other fields. You will be able to meet your business goals on time if you engage a motivated BDE who is professional in their approach to work. Following proper recruiting practices is the key to selecting the perfect BDE for your firm. Only experts with the proper talents, behavioral qualities, and subject expertise will enter your workforce if you have a competitive recruitment strategy in place.</p>



<p>In most cases, a <strong>Business Development Executive</strong> performs the same duties as a Sales Executive or an Account Executive. In the end, this person is in charge of selling a product or service directly to clients. These customers could be other businesses (B2B sales) or individual customers (Business-to-Consumer, or B2C sales).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Business Development Executive, in particular,&#8230;</strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>Creates long-term value for a company through customers, markets, and partnerships.</strong></li><li><strong>Focuses on expanding the company — they investigate possible growth prospects, then assist and supervise their execution.</strong></li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Typical Business Development responsibilities include:</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Using networks and online research, identify and qualify new sales leads.</li><li>Follow up on any sales leads, clearly providing pertinent facts.</li><li>Use telephone, email, and internet contact to build and maintain strong connections with new and existing partners.</li><li>Become a product expert and be able to effectively present the company&#8217;s items to current and new customers.</li><li>Meet sales targets and KPIs on a weekly and monthly basis.</li><li>Attend conferences, meetings, and industry events on behalf of the company.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Putting this part into context&#8230;</strong></h2>



<p><strong>EXAMPLE: </strong>Business Development Executives are employed by a digital marketing business to find and contact potential organizations that might be interested in purchasing digital marketing services. The BDEs will conduct research on firms, analyze their present digital marketing activities, and build relationships with them (most likely via phone and email), recommending ways in which the agency may assist them in improving their digital marketing efforts. They&#8217;ll then keep solid working connections with clients, offering them add-ons and enhancements whenever available, and continually looking for methods to add value and grow the company!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Business Development Executive should have the following core abilities and experience:</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Be an expert in the company&#8217;s products and be able to sell them successfully in any situation.</li><li>Be able to demonstrate a thorough understanding of the company&#8217;s industry and markets.</li><li>Have a knack for selling and recognising business opportunities.</li><li>Have an excellent understanding of (or willingness to learn about) customer relationship management (CRM) systems like Salesforce.</li><li>Feel at ease in a goal-oriented environment and endeavour to overcome any obstacles that may prevent targets from being fulfilled.</li><li>Demonstrate effective time management and planning abilities.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Career path:</strong></h2>



<p>To work in Business Development, you must be an excellent communicator, as previously said. Previous sales or customer service experience is a wonderful method to show that you have this talent as well as a customer-centric mentality. A business degree can also help because it demonstrates that you understand corporate goals and settings.</p>



<p>When it comes to advancement, it&#8217;s normal for a BDE to be promoted to a BDM (Business Development Manager). Taking on additional responsibility for the planning and development of the company&#8217;s growth strategy is likely if you move into this position. You can also expect to be in charge of evaluating the effectiveness of the business development team and managing more junior employees.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Alternative job titles and related roles:</strong></h2>



<p>While positions may have various titles and be located in slightly different departments, many of the same tasks apply to them. Anyone embarking on a job hunt should be aware that roles sometimes overlap, so read job descriptions carefully and perform your own study into specific positions to see if they&#8217;d be a good fit for you. Here are some job titles with responsibilities that are typically quite similar to those of a Business Development Executive to give you an idea of the range available&#8230;</p>



<ul><li>Strategic Account Manager/Executive</li><li>Business Development Representative</li><li>Client Relations Executive</li><li>Sales Executive/Representative</li></ul>

<p>Have you ever had to go through an MBA Job Interviews question asked by hr? If you haven&#8217;t already, I&#8217;m sure you will sooner or later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To assist you in your preparation, we&#8217;ve put together a blog that covers some of the most commonly asked HR interview questions and answers.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/">Learning Routes</a> provides you expert advice and topper&#8217;s personal experience insights on top MBA personal interview questions for Jobs 2021, which will help you ace the interview phase.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Personal &#8211; MBA INTERVIEW QUESTIONS</strong></h2>



<p>The questions for an MBA job interview are divided into two segments, according to our&nbsp;experts. One deals with the candidate&#8217;s personal or personality attributes, while the other aids the interviewer/interviewers in determining the candidate&#8217;s managerial and interpersonal knowledge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Top MBA questions asked during the personal interview round:</p>



<p><strong>Question 1.  Could you please give a quick introduction to yourself? Tell us about yourself in a unique way.</strong><br><strong>Answer- </strong>The subject of how to introduce yourself is one of the most prevalent interview questions. This is an open-ended question.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Only if candidates know how and in what tone to respond to the first question do they have a good chance of gaining the interviewer&#8217;s trust.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>The response should take no more than 2-3 minutes, but it should include all relevant information.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Candidates must demonstrate that they are well-informed about themselves and can articulate that knowledge.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Question 2.  Describe yourself in 03 words.&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Answer &#8211;</strong> Be succinct in your response and use any three adjectives that best describe you.&nbsp;<br>Be self-assured enough to provide three captivating words about your personality that will wow the interviewer or the interviewing panel.&nbsp;<br>Instead of being overly simplistic, candidates can use synonyms to discover fascinating words.</p>



<p><strong>Question 3.  What have you learned thus far from your failures?&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Answer &#8211;</strong> Recognize that it&#8217;s okay to make errors and learn from them. Do not be embarrassed to talk about your failure.&nbsp;<br>Prepare to answer this question, as well as any others connected to failure, because such inquiries are used to assess candidates&#8217; tolerance levels.&nbsp;<br>When addressing or explaining your failure, don&#8217;t come out as broken or disappointed.&nbsp;<br>Instead of focusing on what you&#8217;ve lost, try to concentrate on what you&#8217;ve gained.</p>



<p><strong>Question 4. What are some of the flaws that you&#8217;re working on?&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Answer &#8211;</strong> Instead of diving right into your negative attributes, start with something nice.&nbsp;Demonstrate to the interviewer how you can channel negative energy.&nbsp;<br>If you opt not to answer this question, it may indicate that you are too shy to address things freely.&nbsp;<br>Concentrate more on how you&#8217;re conquering your negative traits, and how much extra effort you&#8217;re putting in to turn the bad into the good.</p>



<p><strong>Questions 5.  Do you have any objectives in mind? Goals over the next five years or ten years?&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Answer </strong>&#8211; In these types of questions, applicants can state their objectives in detail. Begin with a one-year goal and work your way up to five and ten-year plans. Don&#8217;t be hesitant to respond to these questions. People have objectives. Remember APJ Abdul Kalam&#8217;s words: &#8220;You must dream before the dream comes true.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em><strong>Are you looking for MBA Program? <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/nmims-distance-mba/">Join NMIMS Distance MBA Learning Program</a></strong></em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Top MBA Personal Interview Questions for Managers:&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Question 6.  &#8211; According to you, what is the one managerial trait that all managers must possess?&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Answer</strong> &#8211; Don&#8217;t jump to that one attribute right away. List the traits of a manager, such as leadership, communication, decision-making, reliability, and integrity, and then elaborate on the one managerial quality that you believe is the most important. While elaborating about management quality, try to use concise language. Answering this question gives you a chance to talk about something you&#8217;re more passionate about.</p>



<p><strong>Question 7.  Have you ever demonstrated that you are a good manager?&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Answer</strong> &#8211; Because you are applying for an MBA program, the panel may ask you about a time when you had to act as a manager or accept responsibility for something good during the personal interview stage. Make sure you have a good example to back up your answer.</p>



<p><strong>Question 8.  Please elaborate on your achievements. Is there a time when you stood out as a manager and took charge?&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Answer</strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s simple to come up with positive attributes or achievements. Some candidates, on the other hand, may find it difficult to put their feelings into words. Answer MBA job interview questions regarding your achievement, its impact on your life, your experience, what you gained from that accomplishment, and so on. Also, discuss the initiatives you took and the lessons you learned along the way.</p>



<p><strong>Question 9.  Do you believe you will be unable to work with certain types of people in the future?&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Answer</strong> &#8211; Maintain your composure and answer this question in a fair tone, no matter how desperate you are to answer or disclose the other side of the coin by diminishing any other person or personality. A candidate could wind up showing himself or herself in a negative light as a result of doing so.</p>



<p><strong>Question 10.  Elaborate decision-making.</strong><br><strong>Answer</strong> &#8211; Study managerial terms and their definitions, and try to make conclusions for the words ahead of time. This is only an example to demonstrate the importance of managerial words to the candidates. The subject could be anything. Make sure you understand the managerial terms and give a detailed response. You won&#8217;t get through the MBA personal interview stage with one-liners.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Advanced Interview Techniques for MBA Personal Interviews&nbsp;</strong><br>If you are scheduled for a personal interview, basic etiquette such as formal attire, punctuality, and hygiene are required.

<p>A person&#8217;s career is a life decision. It helps you develop your individuality by giving you independence and self-assurance. It is impossible to undo the years of effort and money invested in pursuing an education option. As a result, we must be extremely cautious while selecting a job route.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em><strong>The following are five suggestions to assist you in making an informed career decision:</strong></em></p>



<p><strong># Tip 1: Understand your aptitude and interests:</strong> It is critical that we not only investigate other employment alternatives, but also our own interests, aptitudes, skills, and shortcomings. Self-awareness leads to better professional choices, and hard work looks to be effortless. There are various approaches to determine your ability and interest.&nbsp;Taking psychometric career tests, which provide an indicated career profile, is a common and reliable strategy. In industrialized countries, this strategy is often utilized to begin the career exploration process.</p>



<p><strong># Tip 2: Keep a Career Journal:</strong> Keep a career diary and jot down all of the career alternatives that interest you. Make a list of all the questions you have about it. Make a list of what you hope to get out of your dream job. Writing will help you identify your career goals clearly and ask the proper questions about them. It will prepare you for the <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/career/">career</a> of your dreams. Make it a habit to do so.</p>



<p><strong># Tip 3: Do some research on eligibility requirements:</strong> Each job path has its own set of requirements. Eligibility criteria include age, education, subject requirements, and physical characteristics such as vision, height, and weight. It&#8217;s critical to meet these requirements if you want to pursue your chosen job path. Female flight attendants, for example, must be at least 5 feet 3 inches tall and weigh 58-70 kilograms to be considered for the position of air hostess. Male flight attendants must be between 5 and 6 feet 3 inches tall and weigh between 68 and 82 kilograms. If you don&#8217;t meet these requirements, you won&#8217;t be able to work as an air hostess or flight attendant. Learn about these criteria before choosing your dream career option.</p>



<p><strong># Tip 4: Be familiar with &#8216;A Day in the Life of&#8217;:</strong> Many times, we become attracted by the portrayal of a career based on what we see on television and in movies, but this does not always have to be a real representation of what we would be asked to do on the job. It&#8217;s critical that you do your homework, ask questions, and gather information about what a &#8216;day in the life of a particular career option will entail. Don&#8217;t just ask how much money you can make in a particular career option; instead, find out how many hours you&#8217;ll be expected to work, what kind of work you&#8217;ll be doing, who you&#8217;ll be dealing with, and so on.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong># Tip 5: Consult with a Career Counselor: </strong>Why do we fail to seek advice from a job counselor and discuss our options and seek their opinions when we are preparing to watch a movie or check out ratings and reviews of a new restaurant we are about to dine in? After all, deciding on a career path is a high-stakes decision. You will be better prepared for the future if you seek a professional counselor on a regular basis, and you will be able to make more educated decisions.</p>



<p>These are the five most helpful hints for picking the proper professional path.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The National Association of Colleges and Businesses (NACE) recently conducted a poll to determine the most desirable skills that employers seek when hiring new employees. &#8220;A candidate&#8217;s demonstrated capacity to think critically, speak clearly, and solve complicated problems is more significant than their undergraduate major,&#8221; 93 percent of those polled agreed in a 2013 NACE survey. College curricula provide the opportunity for students to build these leadership and interpersonal abilities, and students should take advantage of these possibilities while also training for their chosen job field, regardless of their major.</p>



<p>Employers value &#8220;soft talents&#8221; for a variety of reasons. They are an essential component of any successful company or organization. Employees must add value to what they provide their employer by being a knowledgeable, proactive member of the team, regardless of the degree they got or the industry they work in, to be an effective, productive part of the team.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The top skills that employers are seeking for are listed below:</strong></h2>



<p><strong>1. Leadership:</strong> The ability to effectively lead or encourage a team is critical in all sorts of enterprises. Employers are looking for someone who can take charge of initiatives without alienating others. Employees in many jobs will be required to work in groups to finish a significant project. True leaders possess a variety of attributes that you should cultivate while in college, including focus, empathy, self-confidence, decisiveness, and optimism. Even if you don&#8217;t have a lot of professional experience, you can improve your skills by participating in group and academic activities.</p>



<p><strong>2. Teamwork:</strong> As the global workplace expands, individuals must be willing and able to work well as part of a team, particularly with people who are different from them. To deliver their goods and services, every industry now partners with other organizations around the world, which means that employees must be able to put aside any preconceived preconceptions about individuals of different ethnicities, faiths, and cultures, as well as personalities. Being able to demonstrate that you are a team player—someone who can work well in a group of people with varying personalities to achieve a goal without allowing your ego to get in the way—will go a long way toward getting employed and progressing up the compensation ladder.</p>



<p><strong>3. Written and Verbal Communication:</strong> Most jobs demand written communication skills. Despite the fact that college students write a lot, businesses still have a hard time identifying job candidates who can express themselves well “on paper.” Solid writing skills set candidates apart regardless of the sorts of writing required in the profession, such as reports, proposals, and even emails. Because much of our contact is done electronically in written form, the ability to write well is even more crucial in our global workplace. The job market will be difficult for those whose writing contains grammar faults, spelling issues, and odd sentences. Make use of the time you have in college to fully develop formal writing skills. In the real world, they will be even more crucial than they are in school.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may have the gift of gab, but are you able to ensure that your listeners receive the genuine message you want to convey? Many occupations allow you to speak with clients and industry influencers, so it&#8217;s critical that you perfect this skill early on. Because so much of our communication is now done through technology, even educated people&#8217;s verbal communication abilities have degraded.</p>

<p><strong>4. Critical Thinking:</strong> All personnel, regardless of field, must be able to think through complicated challenges. Employees frequently perceive only their portion of the process, but they must also understand the &#8220;wide picture&#8221; in order to critically think through challenges and come up with feasible solutions. Unfortunately, college is typically the first time kids are asked to think critically. One of the finest things you can do to improve your future work possibilities is to focus on developing this talent at every opportunity rather than just attempting to get through school to start your career.</p>



<p><strong>5. Problem Solving:</strong> Analysing a problem and devising a practical solution is a life skill that every person requires in order to make informed decisions. This holds true in the workplace as well. An individual with well-honed problem-solving skills saves time and money for firms and organizations. As a result, hiring managers are continuously on the hunt for people who can identify problems, develop alternatives, and implement solutions for the organization.</p>



<p><strong>6. Creative Thinking:</strong> Analysing an issue and devising a viable solution is a life skill that every person requires in order to make sound judgments. This holds true in the workplace as well. An individual with well-honed problem-solving skills saves time and money for firms and organizations. As a result, hiring managers are continuously on the hunt for people who can identify problems, develop alternatives, and implement solutions for the organization.</p>



<p><strong>7. Knowledge:</strong> You will be exposed to a lot of theories during your college years. The theory is critical; it serves as the foundation for a thorough understanding of your field. Employers, on the other hand, require people who can apply what they&#8217;ve learned in the classroom to real-world problems. It may be difficult to put what you&#8217;ve learned into practice before you finish your degree, but you should take advantage of whatever opportunity you have to do so. Whatever your major, you&#8217;ll be expected to apply the theories, tactics, strategies, and formulas you&#8217;ve learned to come up with solutions to the challenges you&#8217;ll face on the job.</p>
