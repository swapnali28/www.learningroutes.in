It&#8217;s that time of year when a student&#8217;s potential to develop a career path and expand their options is at its peak.</p>



<p>Students can pursue a variety of professional opportunities in the Science course with PCM, depending on their interests. Because time is running out, now is an excellent time to make an informed professional decision. This article will inform you about all of the employment opportunities available in the science stream with PCM as the subjects. So, what are you waiting for? Scroll down to learn about the career opportunities open to science students after 12th grade.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">ENGINEERING</h4>



<p>This is one of the most difficult careers in the non-medical science streams. Some students hope to achieve a high score in order to pursue a career as an engineer. To continue with engineering studies, a student can pursue a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) or a Bachelor of Engineering (B.E).</p>



<p>After completing their various engineering degrees, aspirants can apply for opportunities in larger organizations including Software Engineer, Data Analyst, Digital Marketer, Website Developer, Database Designer, and so on. Engineering is available to students in the following fields:</p>



<ul><li>Mechanical Engineering        </li><li>Marine Engineering</li><li>Automobile Engineering</li><li>Environmental Engineering</li><li>Plastic and Polymer Engineering</li><li>Computer Science Engineering</li><li>Aerospace Engineering</li><li>Bio Instrumentation Engineering</li><li>Leather Engineering</li><li>Printing</li><li>Civil Engineering</li><li>Agriculture Engineering</li><li>Bioinformatics Engineering</li><li>Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</li><li>Electronics and Telecommunications</li><li>Petroleum Engineering          </li><li>Chemical Engineering           </li><li>Nanotechnology Engineering</li><li>Information Technology         </li><li>Biochemical Engineering       </li><li>Food Technology Engineering           </li><li>Rubber Engineering   </li><li>Automobile Engineering</li><li>Biomedical Engineering</li><li>Fire Engineering</li><li>Genetic Engineering</li></ul>



<p><strong>Here is the list of <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/top-10-engineering-university-in-india/"><em>Top 10 Engineering University in India</em></a></strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">ARCHITECTURE</h4>



<p>This B. Arch is the second-highest career option for scientific students after engineering. The course teaches the study of design, procedure, building construction, and building structures. This field is a work of art and ideas to make them a reality in the form of houses, buildings, bridges, and so on.</p>



<p>A degree course entails the incorporation of artwork into mathematical and scientific calculations in order to develop the entire framework of a specific project. Candidates can also pursue higher education for postgraduate programs such as Masters in Architecture or Masters in Designing, among others. Architecture Designer, Interior Designer, Architecture Draftsman, Project Assistant Manager, Architecture Engineer, and others are the positions that a B.Arch degree holder can apply for.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">PILOT</h4>



<p>Those who want to fly high into the skies may consider this career. It is ideal for students who do not need to work a 9 to 5 job. This career not only allows you to fly high, but it also offers you the wings to reach your goals. This job combines science, mathematics, and technology with the opportunity to travel to various sites, cities, and even abroad. A pilot&#8217;s job is not easy; it is full of responsibility that a pilot must carry on their strong shoulders in order to properly take off and land the flight.</p>



<p>To become a pilot candidate, candidates must pass various levels of selection, beginning with a written test and progressing to a physical test.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">MERCHANT NAVY</h4>



<p>Merchant Navy is a career that runs in the seas or oceans to convey products, services, and trade to various locations throughout the world via ships. It is one of the several techniques to trade in different nations or across seas. Merchant ships employ a large number of people to transport supplies, machinery, and freight all around the world.</p>



<p>The merchant navy officers remain on the ship until the products and services are delivered. Candidates interested in working in the Merchant Navy can become deck officers, radio officers, engineers, chief engineering officers, and so on. Students who want to become merchant officers must have a high percentage in their scientific stream with PCM as their main subjects.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">NATIONAL DEFENSE SERVICES</h4>



<p>If students have a strong desire to help others, they should put their service to their motherland first. National defense services provide significant and well-respected job possibilities.
