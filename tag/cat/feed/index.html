<p>The Common Admission Test (CAT Exam) is a computer-based MBA examination conducted for admission to the IIMs and other top B-Schools in India. Every year, over 2.3 lakh students sit for the CAT exam in order to gain admission to IIMs. The CAT exam is among the country&#8217;s most popular MBA entrance exams.</p>

<p>The CAT exam is a management entrance exam held in India for admission to 20 IIMs and 1000+ B-schools such as the Faculty of Management Studies at the University of Delhi, MDI Gurgaon &#8211; Management Development Institute, FSM Delhi &#8211; FORE School of Management, MNNIT Allahabad, NITIE Mumbai,&nbsp; K J Somaiya Institute of Management Studies, Mumbai, Great Lakes Institute of Management, Chennai, and others.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CAT Exam Pattern</strong></h2>



<p>Since 2015, the CAT exam has followed a consistent pattern, with the exception of the last two years, which may be repeated for CAT 2022 in terms of time duration, number of questions, and sections, as follows:</p>



<ul><li>CAT 2022 is a two-hour computer-based exam, although it is conducted at an offline exam center.</li><li>There will be at least 18 questions with no negative marking out of a total of 66. The CAT 2022 exam consists of MCQ and Non-MCQ questions, with Non-MCQs carrying no negative marking.</li><li>IIMs demand a minimum qualifying score of 70 to 90 percentile in CAT 2022 in each of the three sections to select candidates for the final admission stage.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CAT Eligibility</strong></h2>



<p>Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused disruptions in assessments across the country, the CAT convening IIM has eliminated the criterion of a minimum of 50 or 45 percent of marks in graduation for appearing in the CAT 2021 exam. This exception applies exclusively to students taking the CAT 2021 exam and who have finished their bachelor&#8217;s degree in 2020 or 2021.A final-year graduate student may also participate in IIM&#8217;s CAT 2022.</p>
