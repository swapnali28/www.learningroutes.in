Then, a PM should delete tasks that are monotonous and kill time. </li><li>The PM should create a receptive environment, and ideas should be shared among the group in order to facilitate innovation.</li><li>Breaks should be given and taken in order to increase efficiency.</li><li>Deadlines should be set, to accelerate growth.</li><li>Multi-tasking should not be encouraged, instead, a PM should focus on one thing at a time in order to minimise mistakes and increase efficiency.</li></ol>
