<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Cover Letter</h4>



<p>A cover letter is like a personalised application letter that you send along with your resume. The particulars of the cover letter describe how you are a good fit for the particular job that you have applied for.&nbsp;</p>

<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
