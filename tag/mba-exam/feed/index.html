<p>The Common Admission Test (CAT Exam) is a computer-based MBA examination conducted for admission to the IIMs and other top B-Schools in India. Every year, over 2.3 lakh students sit for the CAT exam in order to gain admission to IIMs. The CAT exam is among the country&#8217;s most popular MBA entrance exams.</p>



<p>The Common Admission Test, abbreviated as CAT, is a computer-based entrance exam for MBA/PGDM admissions at 20 IIMs and 1000+ Business Schools in India. Every year, one of the 20 IIMs administers the CAT exam. The CAT 2022 is anticipated to be held this year at IIM Bangalore.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why gives </strong>CAT<strong>?</strong></h2>



<p>The CAT exam is a management entrance exam held in India for admission to 20 IIMs and 1000+ B-schools such as the Faculty of Management Studies at the University of Delhi, MDI Gurgaon &#8211; Management Development Institute, FSM Delhi &#8211; FORE School of Management, MNNIT Allahabad, NITIE Mumbai,&nbsp; K J Somaiya Institute of Management Studies, Mumbai, Great Lakes Institute of Management, Chennai, and others.</p>



<p>To get into one of India&#8217;s top management schools you need a CAT percentile of 95 to 99+. The following are some of the best MBA colleges in India that accept CAT results, as well as their CAT cutoff.</p>



<ul><li>Management Development Institute (MDI) Gurgaon &#8211; 95+ Percentile</li><li>National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE) Mumbai &#8211; 95+ Percentile</li><li>SP Jain Institute of Management and Research (SPJIMR) Mumbai &#8211; 85+ Percentile</li><li>Department of Management Studies, IIT Madras &#8211; 95+ Percentile</li><li>T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI) Manipal &#8211; 85+ Percentile</li><li>DMS, IIT Delhi &#8211; 98+ Percentile</li><li>Loyola Institute of Business Administration (LIBA) Chennai &#8211; 90+ Percentile</li><li>Xavier Institute of Management Bhubaneswar (XIMB) &#8211; 90+ Percentile</li><li>Institute of Management Technology (IMT) Ghaziabad &#8211; 90+ Percentile</li></ul>

This exception applies exclusively to students taking the CAT 2021 exam and who have finished their bachelor&#8217;s degree in 2020 or 2021.A final-year graduate student may also participate in IIM&#8217;s CAT 2022.</p>

<p>CMAT 2022 is one of the main national level MBA admission exams for MBA/PGDM 2022-24 batch in AICTE recognized management colleges, and it will be conducted as a three-hour computer-based test by National Testing Agency (NTA). A high CMAT 2022 score will provide MBA admission opportunities in 1000 AICTE-approved MBA/PGDM institutes. CMAT is an abbreviation for Common Management Admission Test (CMAT).CMAT was previously administered by AICTE; however, the test is currently administered by the Government of India&#8217;s National Testing Authority (NTA). Every year, around 70,000 applicants apply for the CMAT. CMAT provides a one-of-a-kind opportunity to all exam takers because no one is rejected as a result of its results.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why give CMAT?</strong></h4>



<p>MBA hopefuls encounter a plethora of MBA entrance tests at the national, state, and institute levels and become perplexed as to which MBA entrance exam they should apply for and sit in. Here are a few pointers which prove CMAT to be highly beneficial:</p>



<ul><li>Difficulty level: medium</li><li>Even if a test taker has a score of zero, he or she is not banned from taking the CMAT.</li><li>CMAT provides MBA/PGDM admission opportunities at AICTE-approved management institutes.</li><li>you would have already taken other major MBA entrance tests such as CAT, IIFT, XAT, NMAT, and SNAP, among others, by the time CMAT is held. As a result, there is no need to put in extra effort to prepare for the CMAT exam because it has the same sectional makeup and a reduced level of difficulty.</li><li>Most of India&#8217;s top MBA/PGDM universities accept CMAT scores for admission. Among these are JBIMS, SIMSREE, K J Somaiya, Welingkar, PUMBA, Great Lakes, GIM Goa, IMT Nagpur, BIMTECH Greater Noida, and 330 MBA/MMS colleges in Maharashtra.</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CMAT Test pattern</strong></h4>



<p>It is a 3-hour long exam consisting of 5 sections- Quantitative Technique, General Awareness and Innovation, Logical Reasoning,&nbsp; Entrepreneurship, and Language Comprehension. Each section has 20 questions.</p>



<ul><li>For the three-hour exam, there will be 100 questions.</li><li>All of the questions are objective in nature and are in the form of multiple-choice questions (MCQs).</li><li>The difficulty level of the questions is easily modifiable.</li><li>Each right answer receives a +4 mark.</li><li>Each incorrect answer is penalized with a -1 point deduction.</li><li>There is no time limit for attempting the question paper on an individual basis. Within the entire CMAT exam timeframe, candidates may attempt any question out of any area.</li><li>The Merit Score and percentile are derived using all of the sections.</li><li>The CMAT result card displays the actual score out of 400 marks, the sectional score, and the sectional and aggregate percentile attained in the exam.</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CMAT important dates</strong></h4>
