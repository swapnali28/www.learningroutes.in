<p>The National Association of Colleges and Businesses (NACE) recently conducted a poll to determine the most desirable skills that employers seek when hiring new employees. &#8220;A candidate&#8217;s demonstrated capacity to think critically, speak clearly, and solve complicated problems is more significant than their undergraduate major,&#8221; 93 percent of those polled agreed in a 2013 NACE survey. College curricula provide the opportunity for students to build these leadership and interpersonal abilities, and students should take advantage of these possibilities while also training for their chosen job field, regardless of their major.</p>



<p>Employers value &#8220;soft talents&#8221; for a variety of reasons. They are an essential component of any successful company or organization. Employees must add value to what they provide their employer by being a knowledgeable, proactive member of the team, regardless of the degree they got or the industry they work in, to be an effective, productive part of the team.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The top skills that employers are seeking for are listed below:</strong></h2>



<p><strong>1. Leadership:</strong> The ability to effectively lead or encourage a team is critical in all sorts of enterprises. Employers are looking for someone who can take charge of initiatives without alienating others. Employees in many jobs will be required to work in groups to finish a significant project. True leaders possess a variety of attributes that you should cultivate while in college, including focus, empathy, self-confidence, decisiveness, and optimism. Even if you don&#8217;t have a lot of professional experience, you can improve your skills by participating in group and academic activities.</p>



<p><strong>2. Teamwork:</strong> As the global workplace expands, individuals must be willing and able to work well as part of a team, particularly with people who are different from them. To deliver their goods and services, every industry now partners with other organizations around the world, which means that employees must be able to put aside any preconceived preconceptions about individuals of different ethnicities, faiths, and cultures, as well as personalities. Being able to demonstrate that you are a team player—someone who can work well in a group of people with varying personalities to achieve a goal without allowing your ego to get in the way—will go a long way toward getting employed and progressing up the compensation ladder.</p>



<p><strong>3. Written and Verbal Communication:</strong> Most jobs demand written communication skills. Despite the fact that college students write a lot, businesses still have a hard time identifying job candidates who can express themselves well “on paper.” Solid writing skills set candidates apart regardless of the sorts of writing required in the profession, such as reports, proposals, and even emails. Because much of our contact is done electronically in written form, the ability to write well is even more crucial in our global workplace. The job market will be difficult for those whose writing contains grammar faults, spelling issues, and odd sentences. Make use of the time you have in college to fully develop formal writing skills. In the real world, they will be even more crucial than they are in school.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may have the gift of gab, but are you able to ensure that your listeners receive the genuine message you want to convey? Many occupations allow you to speak with clients and industry influencers, so it&#8217;s critical that you perfect this skill early on. Because so much of our communication is now done through technology, even educated people&#8217;s verbal communication abilities have degraded.</p>

<p><strong>4. Critical Thinking:</strong> All personnel, regardless of field, must be able to think through complicated challenges. Employees frequently perceive only their portion of the process, but they must also understand the &#8220;wide picture&#8221; in order to critically think through challenges and come up with feasible solutions. Unfortunately, college is typically the first time kids are asked to think critically. One of the finest things you can do to improve your future work possibilities is to focus on developing this talent at every opportunity rather than just attempting to get through school to start your career.</p>



<p><strong>5. Problem Solving:</strong> Analysing a problem and devising a practical solution is a life skill that every person requires in order to make informed decisions. This holds true in the workplace as well. An individual with well-honed problem-solving skills saves time and money for firms and organizations. As a result, hiring managers are continuously on the hunt for people who can identify problems, develop alternatives, and implement solutions for the organization.</p>



<p><strong>6. Creative Thinking:</strong> Analysing an issue and devising a viable solution is a life skill that every person requires in order to make sound judgments. This holds true in the workplace as well. An individual with well-honed problem-solving skills saves time and money for firms and organizations. As a result, hiring managers are continuously on the hunt for people who can identify problems, develop alternatives, and implement solutions for the organization.</p>



<p><strong>7. Knowledge:</strong> You will be exposed to a lot of theories during your college years. The theory is critical; it serves as the foundation for a thorough understanding of your field. Employers, on the other hand, require people who can apply what they&#8217;ve learned in the classroom to real-world problems. It may be difficult to put what you&#8217;ve learned into practice before you finish your degree, but you should take advantage of whatever opportunity you have to do so. Whatever your major, you&#8217;ll be expected to apply the theories, tactics, strategies, and formulas you&#8217;ve learned to come up with solutions to the challenges you&#8217;ll face on the job.</p>
