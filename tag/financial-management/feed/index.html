<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Scope of Financial Management</h2>



<p>To comprehend the scope of Financial Management, it is crucial to be familiar with four factors that Financial Managers consider while making decisions in an organisation. These factors include investment, financing, dividend, and Liquidity Decisions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">•Financing Decisions</h3>



<p>A Financial Manager must decide how to obtain sufficient funds to meet the firm&#8217;s requirements. This involves determining the appropriate balance between equity and debt, known as the firm&#8217;s capital structure. As a Financial Manager, you must strive to achieve an optimal capital structure while making financing decisions. An optimal capital structure is one in which the market value of shares is maximised.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">• Investment Decisions</h3>



<p>As a Financial Manager, you will play a critical role in deciding the most suitable investment options based on the available finance, considering both long-term and short-term considerations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Long-term investment decisions, also known as Capital Budgeting, involve selecting the most appropriate investment proposal(s) by evaluating various factors to determine the one that aligns with the company&#8217;s goals and plans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, short-term investment decisions involve selecting the best use of funds in the short run, such as managing current assets.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">• Dividend Decisions</h3>



<p>Financial Management also encompasses the decision-making process related to dividend distribution. As a Financial Manager, you will have to evaluate various factors and determine the best course of action, such as distributing profits among shareholders, retaining them for future use, or distributing a specific portion and returning the rest to the company.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">• Liquidity Decisions</h3>



<p>Effective management of current assets is essential to maintain the profitability and liquidity of a firm. As a Financial Manager, your responsibility is to efficiently manage all existing assets to protect the firm from illiquidity risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This involves identifying and implementing the most appropriate techniques for current asset management, ensuring that funds are available when needed.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
