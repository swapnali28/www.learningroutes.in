<p>In this dynamic era of digitalisation and innovation, most of us are continuously aiming to improve our skills and enhance our knowledge. The best way to do this for working professionals and corporate employees is by earning an Executive MBA degree which helps them to learn advanced management concepts and real-world applications, brush &amp; learn new skills as well as keep up with the pace of development at their workplace. This programme caters to build great networking opportunities with high-level executives from a variety of industries.</p>



<p>An <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/nmims-executive-mba-wx-programs/">Executive MBA</a> or an EMBA holds a lot of similarities with a regular MBA degree, but is basically designed keeping in mind the unique needs of working professionals, business leaders and corporate employees who aim to improve their knowledge while they are still employed. An EMBA programme provides a comprehensive view of the organisation to its students, guides them to deal with the complex structures of the organisation and inculcates in them a deeper know-how of the business processes. </p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Eligibility Criteria</strong></h3>



<p>In order to pursue an EMBA, the person should be eligible as per the requirements. The admissibility for the same can be discussed as follows: <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>The individual who wants to do an EMBA should have a graduation degree or a master’s degree from a recognised institution. He should possess a minimum of 50% in his highest qualification. The minimum marks required vary from university to university.&nbsp;</li><li>He should have adequate work experience which is generally around 2-3 years.&nbsp;</li><li>The candidate should have excellent communication skills and should be proficient in the English language.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>*Note: Most universities don’t go for entrance exams, however, it depends on the university whether or not an entrance exam is required.</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Course Duration</strong></h3>



<p>It takes around 24 months to complete a distance EMBA program which has about 4 terms or semesters. However, the duration for a distance Executive MBA varies for different institutes. In some universities, it lasts for a year while in others, the course is of a 2-year duration. </p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fee Structure</strong></h3>



<p>The course fee varies depending on the college, duration of the course and many other factors. However, the average fee ranges from INR 50,000 to INR 5 lac for the entire course. Candidates have the option to pay the fees in instalments which makes it manageable. There are also many universities and B- schools that conduct various scholarship tests to make the course more economical. </p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Executive MBA: Specially Crafted for Working Professionals</strong></h3>



<p>Working professionals who are looking to upgrade their career are likely to pursue this course. The course certainly adds value to their career by updating them with the latest happenings in the industry and bringing them the opportunity to acquire relevant leadership skills. Moreover, they can pursue this course while continuing to work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thus, distance EMBA is an ideal course for professionals as it helps them develop entrepreneurial as well as managerial skills which are an inseparable part of any business or organisation. Apart from this, an EMBA course would help students gain thorough knowledge about different areas of management such as HR Management, Finance, International Business, Business Analytics, Operations &amp; Supply Chain, Leadership &amp; Strategy, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides knowledge, the individuals who pursue an EMBA also get adequate opportunities to develop excellent communication skills, strategic thinking abilities, analytical skills, decision making skills, leadership qualities, etc. Therefore, a distance learning EMBA program not only increases the theoretical knowledge of candidates but also provides an intensive practical experience of the real-time business world. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Distance EMBA vs Regular MBA</strong></h3>



<p>Both regular MBA and distance EMBA are quite similar but there are certain distinctions which make them different from each other. So, here are some key differences between the two:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Flexibility</strong>: </h4>



<p>In a distance EMBA course, the aspirants have a flexible learning schedule, self-paced learning and the advantage of learning while doing work. On the other hand, in the case of a regular MBA, one has to be physically present in the classes. </p>



<div style="height:2px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Course Duration:</strong></h4>



<p>A distance EMBA course can have a comparatively shorter duration as compared to a regular MBA programme. </p>



<div style="height:2px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Work Experience:</strong></h4>



<p>An adequate work experience of around 2-5 years is a prerequisite for pursuing a distance EMBA course. While for a regular MBA degree work experience may or may not be a necessary precondition.</p>



<div style="height:2px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. <strong>Fee Structure:</strong></h4>



<p>A distance EMBA course has comparatively less fees as compared to a regular MBA course.</p>



<div style="height:2px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. <strong>On the basis of Learning:</strong></h4>



<p>The curriculum of a regular MBA is covered by highly educated and skilled professors who hold expertise in their fields. But, in an EMBA the aspirants are taught by professors who have intensive knowledge about their specialisation and industry experts who provide them with real-time business world experiences. Moreover, the EMBA curriculum is more practical-oriented as compared to a regular MBA.</p>



<p>Therefore, an EMBA is a course that is an ideal choice for working professionals which will help them to enhance their skills and knowledge, while they are at work. Whereas, a regular MBA is for students who are willing to attend regular classes for doing an MBA programme.</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Salary Expectations</strong></h3>



<p>EMBA is one of the most premiere courses around the globe and provides you with innumerable job opportunities and high designations with higher salaries. The remuneration criteria vary depending upon a lot of factors.</p>



<p>The average salary packages of different EMBA courses can be classified as follows:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Brand Manager- INR 14 Lac per annum</li><li>Operations Director- INR 30 Lac per annum</li><li>Senior Accountant- INR 4 Lac per annum</li><li>HR Executive- INR 5 Lac per annum</li></ul>



<p>Apart from these, aspirants get a chance to work in various reputed job profiles such as Senior Business Analyst, Management Consultant, Business Development Manager, Brand Manager, etc. These job profiles provide you with a great learning experience and increase your horizons in the business world. Additionally, the perks and emoluments they offer are huge, both in quantitative as well as qualitative aspects. </p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Takeaway&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>An EMBA would be a great opportunity for aspirants who don&#8217;t want to be stagnant in their careers and want continuous growth in their personal as well as professional lives. The course offers a greater understanding of the curriculum and thorough knowledge of the real business world which would help you to achieve greater milestones in your professional life.</p>
