<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the Scenario of the Job Market in 2023?</strong></h3>



<p>The job market is bound to change constantly due to the changing needs and technology in the world and thus, it becomes difficult to figure out how to prepare for a job at the right time. There was a tremendous change in the job market during and post-pandemic as there were a great number of layoffs, shortage of jobs, and an increased unemployment rate. But the post-pandemic era also lured us with newer jobs and changing work trends like working from home was the “new normal” and till date many companies encourage it. But as we are reaching the end of 2022, what will be the scenario of jobs in 2023?</p>



<p><strong>As of 2022, many new employment opportunities in the IT, real estate and health sectors are seen with the IT sector leading the race. FY2022 recorded a 15.5% growth which was the highest ever, reaching USD 270 billion in revenue. It is also seen as a year of tech startups. </strong>A trend that will definitely see a significant boost in 2023 is a shift from theoretical knowledge to a focus on soft skills. An employer would likely hire somebody who can crack that code, build a strong strategy or create amazing graphics. Employers will tend to seek employees who have strong communication skills, problem-solving abilities and team-building abilities because these qualities reflect adaptability and flexibility in an ever-changing workplace. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5 Tips to Become Job Ready in the Changing Job Market:</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Understanding the Current Job Market and Trends</strong></h4>



<p>Since the job market is bound to evolve with changing times, it becomes crucial to stay up-to-date with the changing trends. Hence, research plays a very important role when it comes to understanding the job market. For instance, it helps to understand which trend might last more than 10 years. One such example is:  post-pandemic people started preferring remote or work from home and this trend is likely to persist in the coming years. There are even more diverse modes of work emerging such as freelancing, contract projects and much more. Many people are finding self-employment to be a better option than working from the office. It, therefore, becomes obvious that the current job market demands you to be flexible at work and tech-savvy. </p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Explore Newly Evolving Fields</strong></h4>



<p>India has a mixed economy which makes it an attractive country for many diverse job sectors. But, it was seen that India’s economy was sick before the coronavirus crisis and it went even more down during the pandemic. The pandemic also brought about the scenario of online systems and the boost in sectors like digital marketing which is evolving drastically and thereby is creating newer job opportunities. Along with that, technology-driven job profiles are also expected to see a boost. According to Business Standards, “Two-thirds<strong> of Indian knowledge workers are likely to switch jobs in 2023.” </strong>Additionally, studies have also shown that Indian<strong> gaming will add up to 1 lakh jobs in the year 2023. </strong></p>

<p>You need to grow and learn new skills to be updated with the ongoing changes.

<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. <strong>Gain Experience</strong></h4>



<p>Employers would definitely prefer to hire an experienced person but that does not mean that freshers can never land a job. Students, generally, opt for internships during their college education which helps them to hone their skills and understand the nuances of the industry. Additionally, this also helps the students to expand their network which can assist them to land their dream job in future.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Global Recession 2023</strong></h3>



<p>According to the leading economic research organisations, the world is going to face a global recession by the year 2023. The upcoming uncertainty around the global recession makes one wonder about the jobs that will stay unaffected by it. Young people entering the workforce are using their resources to develop recession-proof skills to shine in their respective careers. There are various sectors that do not get affected by the recession. The growth rate in these sectors does not decrease. Some of the sectors that will remain unaffected by the global recession 2023 are:-&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Medical and Healthcare</strong></h4>



<p>Our physical and mental healthcare does not care about what is going on with the economy. It is certain that in a global recession, the healthcare industry does not get affected. For instance, in times like COVID Pandemic &#8211; healthcare and wellbeing industry benefited the most while the other industries lagged behind. This industry offers the maximum job security to the workforce. In India, this industry contributes 5% to the GDP and is expected to rise at 22.87% in the following years.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Education&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>The education industry is one such industry that stays intact no matter how much the economy is affected. The education sector experiences a boost as many people return to schools and colleges to continue their education. Nowadays, open and distance learning has also emerged drastically. By 2025, the distance education industry is expected to rise by 2.28 Billion USD.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Public Utility</strong></h4>



<p>Workers in the utility sector enjoy a certain amount of job security even in the time of recession. The utility sector consists of electricity, water, internet services and waste management and these services are still required by the people even when the economy is in recession.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. <strong>Credit and Debt Management Counsellors</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Credit and Debt management becomes important especially during recession.&nbsp; People consult counsellors for smart management of their finances. Services of management counsellors are in great demand during the time of global recession.&nbsp; The industry can experience considerable growth during the period of global economic stagnation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. <strong>Consumer Packaged Goods Services&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>The consumer and packaged goods industry is the staple of any consumer. Especially the consumers that are young in age as they tend to become more reliant on packaged goods. The packaged goods are usually staple items and people will buy these goods and items even at the time of economic slowdown. This is usually the reason why this sector is not bound to really face the repercussions of the global recession. People working in this industry will not be influenced by recession. In Fact, in the year 2020, that too during the pandemic, the industry experienced a growth rate from 108.1% to 108.8%.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The IT Industry and the Global Recession&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>In the year 2020-21, the IT industry saw an exponential growth of 12%. According to the World Bank, 2023 will witness an increase in global inflation rate by 5%. As the world will be facing the global economic slowdown in 2023, the jobs in the IT sector are considered to be least affected by the recession. The reason for believing such an effect on the IT industry is the recent drop in the attrition of the Indian softtech-giant Infosys by 27.1%. Due to our increasing reliance on digital means for daily functions, the IT industry is experiencing a boom holistically. The big IT firms like Infosys, TCS and Wipro have bagged great deals with international enterprises. According to Kotak Institutional Equities, ‘<em> Tech spending continues to be a vital area of focus as banks and financial services firms are in the early stages or in the midst of a tech upgrade journey.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The growth in the Information Technology sector can be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic as most of the workspaces went digital. The IT industry saw a boom in the years 2020 and 2021. The pandemic compelled people to develop recession-proof skills like communication, Remote Project Management and flexibility. It was believed that after the pandemic, our reliance on IT services will decrease, however, the recent statistics point to the opposite. According to the Bureau of Labour Statistics, tech-related jobs are all set to grow in the next decade. Within the IT industry, there are certain job profiles that are considered to be recession-proof as well as highly rewarding at the times of global recession.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><em>“Who looks outside; dreams, Who looks inside, awakes”</em></strong></p><cite><strong><em>&#8211; Carl Jung</em></strong></cite></blockquote>



<p>As per Carl Jung, if you want to know anything about anything, be it a person, business, product, or relationship, between two things or even if you&#8217;re going to win a war, it comes from pieces of information and information comes from within. To have a clear understanding of the question of whether or not it is good to do an MBA after a Bachelor’s in Psychology, we need to understand how Psychology can be used in Business Management. Especially what are the aspects you can address that a non-psychology student can&#8217;t? To cut it short, understand how you can use psychology in your responsibilities to increase your overall performance as a manager. Now the question that comes to mind is: </p>



<p><strong>What are the Skills Required as a “BUSINESS MANAGER”?</strong></p>



<p>Business Management is among the top-ranked careers and with the fast pace of development, it is expected to rise beyond imagination. <strong><em>“Change will be happening so quickly that 50% of the occupations that exist today will not exist 10 years from now. So we’re going to be living in an environment that is extremely adaptable and changing all the time,”</em></strong> says Liz Bentley, the founder of Liz Bentley Associates. Thus, it can be interpreted that Business Management is here to stay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every company anywhere in the world is looking for a person who has foundational knowledge and can convert them into unique skills because “the bossy” attitude and approach is not going to work in a tight labour market where “logical reason” is everything. Skills like reasoning, negotiation, organising resources, leadership and relationship building with your management, colleagues and subordinates are of utmost importance. As there is a saying in defence forces</p>



<p><strong><em>“TAKE CARE OF YOUR MEN AND THE MEN WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU!”</em></strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/POC8SoGXgrpKZwgJgjshUSY2AdIBX8Ck0nE_vGmQ77cg_4kS2UlNns2tkMTJcWEvlVsdiP4OdS76c8Y759B00h3xe8vCCNDKnY7-gpDwqnApabIl6kpPV2XnmGeh5wqAdxymdmqvbtnU50IWkNdB2LB58t8_lQrw4xGM0dBckPXnfZz0N8FMUptFdpLAwQ" alt=""/></figure>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Skills Required by Business Managers</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Technology Management Skills</strong></h4>



<p>The change the world, especially India, has seen in the last 20 years in terms of technology deployment and involvement in workplaces is drastic. From no Internet, and working on hard copies to 5G and software management systems, the world has changed a lot. Those who didn&#8217;t keep up faced many difficulties. “To grow together” is the only option we all have.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Out Centric Leadership Skills</strong></h4>



<p>As per definition the person who leads or commands a group, an organisation, or a country. But a true leader knows way beyond that! Taking care of your people while making sure everything grows with it. Building teams or growing a business is an integral part of it, this is where psychology steps in. Having a clear understanding of the people you work with, about their strengths and weaknesses also falls under the responsibility of the leader.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Soft-Skill Assessment</strong></h4>



<p><strong><em>“Effective managers are going to have to be as good at evaluating candidates and employees for soft skills as they are for technical skills,”</em></strong> says Rita Santelli, CEO of innovation consulting firm Savvy. If there is no good communication there is no growth because subordinates will not be able to share ideas, problems and solutions. Other soft skills that are important from a business point of view are time management, critical thinking, problem-solving and a few others. If a manager has learnt to establish the right balance of these skills, that’s when he is able to truly use psychology in his day-to-day managerial responsibilities.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Results-Only Work Environment</strong></h4>



<p>Over the years increased productivity is the end goal of any company which involves the maximum input from everyone i.e. individual productivity increase. Addressing issues leads to increased efficiency which comes from an understanding of the environment and persons.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Transparency</strong></h4>



<p>A shift from a non-traditional way, requires answers for what, why and how. Transparency plays a vital role to answer those questions because it builds trust among colleagues. Trust allows you to have strong connections and which further leads to an effective and highly motivated team.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Emotional Intelligence</strong></h4>



<p>As a leader, it is very important to understand and recognise your own emotions as well the emotions of those around you. It helps you bring strong bonds with your team and helps you establish an atmosphere of cooperation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Don’t these skills make you believe that as a psychology student, you are the perfect fit for managerial positions? Then why not increase your chances by pursuing an MBA degree?</p>



<p>The understanding of human behaviour that you have already gives you an upper hand over others. During your MBA, you will acquire valuable hard and soft skills that will prepare you to traverse through the thick waters of the business world.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hard and Soft Skills Necessary for Business Administration:&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>HARD SKILLS</strong></td><td><strong>SOFT SKILLS</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Critical Reasoning</td><td>Communication</td></tr><tr><td>Psychology and Cognitive Science Fundamentals</td><td>Critical Thinking</td></tr><tr><td>Quantitative and Qualitative Research</td><td>Listening</td></tr><tr><td>Experiment Design</td><td>Empathy</td></tr><tr><td>Experiential Learning</td><td>Creative Problem Solving</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The best and the most important part that will act as a catalyst in your career of business management is <strong>“BEHAVIOURAL PSYCHOLOGY.”</strong></p>



<p>The systematic approach to understanding the behaviour of humans is behaviourism or behavioural sciences. With this knowledge, you will be able to understand the behavioural patterns of your colleagues, will know them better, how they are as an individual, how you as a manager take out their most productive self and much more. You can also enhance these skills while doing an MBA.</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Career Prospects for Psychology Students after MBA&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>As we have read and understood that psychology students can make great leaders, hence, it is also easy for them to tap into the job market. Studies have shown that only 34% of the people come from a management field but on the other hand, 66% of the people come from non-management fields into managerial positions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are some of the job prospects in Business Management that a psychology student can pursue after MBA:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Corporate Leaders&nbsp;</li><li>Human Resource Professionals</li><li>Social Worker Executives&nbsp;</li><li>Industrial Counselor</li><li>Corporate Consultant, and many others.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>The amalgamation of psychology and MBA is drastic and it opens doors of job possibilities for the students. Additionally, these jobs are highly lucrative and are expected to contribute to the job market in the long run.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h3>



<p>There is no doubt that an MBA will be beneficial for you after a bachelor&#8217;s in psychology. It will not only help you to elevate your career but will also bring opportunities for personality development.</p>
