										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Can you drive a car if you have no clue about the breaks or clutch? Can you cook without a recipe? If your answer to these questions is no, how can you think of running a whole business without having a relevant qualification when you cannot do the basic tasks without learning them.</p>



<p>You may get inspired by all the college dropouts who turned into successful businessmen and might consider doing the same. It sounds encouraging that a person reached to million dollars worth from nothing, but unfortunately, the reality is different, and there is more to the truth than you can see. You can not undervalue a degree based on a few examples. To run a company, knowledge and skills are required, which you can learn only after investing your time in studying.</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Here are ten reasons you should give value to an MBA before entering into Entrepreneurship</strong>.</h3>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Creates Network- To support your firm</strong></h4>



<p>For any company to flourish, the main requirement is customers, stakeholders, suppliers, and employees. In other words, people who buy your product and help you create the product are your assets. Now, How to build that asset? Connections are your answer. Making trusting connections with all the people you rely upon is a crucial component of entrepreneurship. Therefore, the success of entrepreneurs depends on developing relationships before they launch.</p>



<p>Through a professional degree, you learn to build a support network through your study. An MBA will help you here. It will allow you to connect with like-minded people and build friendships across industries. You have access to an alumni network as well. They frequently interact with each other and people who are in their contact. They could be able to put you in touch with someone who can advance your company. In your initial days, when you are working on starting your venture, your network will assist you. You can quickly get helped with seed funding and expertise based on your link.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Adds value- By building trust in your clients</strong></h4>



<p>Your potential customer knows how prestigious an MBA degree is, and they know its value. Owing to that, they will consider you a trustworthy person as MBA is a prestigious degree and is widely regarded as a mark of corporate excellence. Such credibility will lead to an increase in your worth. Therefore, they will be much more likely to listen and take your advice seriously when they receive it. Hence, earning a general master&#8217;s degree in business administration will enhance your business sharpness and get the respect of clients.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Education- Expansion in Knowledge&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>You will gain knowledge about managing investments, raising capital, and starting (and running) a firm, from LLCs to non-profits. Such kind of knowledge is priceless because it saves you the time and effort it would take you to figure everything out on your own.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. More strategic approach- So that your people can align with your vision</strong></h4>



<p>The most crucial conversation at a start-up is the strategic one. It clarifies a company&#8217;s priorities, shapes its direction, and makes it easier for everyone to work toward the same objectives. It is also the most challenging talk to make when starting a company. This is because it expects founders to describe their vision clearly so its staff can work accordingly. Additionally, they must make challenging trade-offs between immediate requirements and long-term expansion.</p>



<p>Comparable to building a house without the right tools is attempting to excel at strategic dialogues without attending business school. You can do it, but it will be significantly more challenging, and you&#8217;ll inevitably make some costly errors.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/fZsHJ2JhrCmK9W79sbhZ-i3CsGPQR3NtP7tJ6QWNMz7xz8x5AASjVjAJ0kSiLOjIlLpU-27xBeqEPaaRklbU2yzJWTT4Ts6aNwmLn-VD4EHbUYkVZc8w2CKHOx3aH5cI0oviFgQ1q0YFFwp_s9Xdjq8" alt=""/></figure>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Mentorship- Makes you better</strong></h4>



<p>If you are doing a degree, you undergo a lot of hardships dealing with the people training you. They will put you in all kinds of situations to become the best version of yourself in terms of management, analytical skills, leadership qualities, etc. You can lose this opportunity of polishing up if you do not choose to do a degree and start working without it.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Bigger Perspective- The ability to think globally</strong></h4>



<p>Students come to business schools from all around the world. This implies that the group of people you will join will contribute a variety of thoughts and opinions to business operations and other situations. You will develop a global mentality and a thorough awareness of global trends and market dynamics as you stay in their company.</p>



<p>When it is said the ability to think globally, &nbsp;it means the skill to work comfortably with professionals from different walks of life, and this is highly encouraged by UK Centre for Economics and Business. So, doing an MBA will help you get these much-needed visions for your company.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>7. Smartness-To keep you up with the alterations</strong></h4>



<p>The market in which you will deal keeps on changing. Every day there are new concepts, working techniques, and expansions in different areas. Being an MBA student will provide you with the technical knowledge necessary to make profitable and wise decisions according to the changes coming in the industry. You will learn to manage risk assessment, do precise cost-benefit evaluations, and many more.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>8. Increase in Leadership qualities-Transform your ideas</strong></h4>



<p>Any group working together for running a firm never has a shortage of ideas.</p>



<p>What matters more than ideas is the appropriate execution of them so that they can turn into a successful reality. Such work can only be done by or under a great leader. If you enroll in a Master&#8217;s course, you will be able to learn how to improve your leadership abilities along with several practical money management techniques.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>9. Contests- Pre-preparation for future</strong></h4>



<p>Top Business Schools usually organize competitions among the students as a part of their activities to evaluate their ideas and encourage them. A contest is held where each participant comes up with their start-up idea, and the one with the most important business strategy wins. So, you can always consider it a &#8220;practice run&#8221; for creating a company that will generate significant revenues.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>10 Mandatory tricks- To scale your business</strong></h4>



<p>If you want your firm to do wonders, it is crucial for you to understand how to expand it. There is a huge difference between handling a small business and one which has hundreds of employees. As your revenue grows, it&#8217;s important to understand how to do the appropriate hiring, how to align your team with your vision, and how to engage your staff in your goals. An <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/nmims-distance-mba/">MBA</a> will help to inculcate the skills required to upscale your start-up as you will get familiar with the subjects like operations management, finance, and market strategies.</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="has-text-align-left wp-block-heading"><strong>Here is a table with Top MBA courses that can be beneficial for running a&nbsp;company</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Export and Import Management</td><td>Understanding procedures and documentation involved in imports and exports.</td></tr><tr><td>Foreign Exchange Management</td><td>Currency Conversion,fluctuation in currency rates.How to guard against foreign exchange rates.</td></tr><tr><td>International Finance</td><td>Learning how to raise capital for operating firm from International Markets.</td></tr><tr><td>International Marketing</td><td>Learning methods to approach customers in foreign markets.</td></tr><tr><td>International Logistics</td><td>Understanding the International distribution network in order to deliver the goods in foreign nations.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>You can achieve everything you set your mind to if you believe in yourself. There are no limitations out here, and the only ones you set are for yourself. MBA Chai Wala&#8217;s owner, Prafull Billore, was determined to pursue his dreams and succeeded. He had his share of setbacks, but he overcame them to get to where he is now. His success story serves as an encouragement to today&#8217;s kids.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>His upbringing and challenges</strong></h2>



<p>Prafull intended to get his master&#8217;s degree from IIM Ahmedabad before launching his own eatery. You must take the CAT in order to be accepted into a <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/nmims-ngasce/">good MBA program</a>. The CAT is regarded as one of the most demanding exams available. Prafull studied for over 10 hours a day to achieve his objectives. His parents wished him well and hoped he would pass his examinations. Unfortunately, he failed the CAT exam three times out of three attempts. Despite his failure, his parents continued to support him. Prafull became depressed as a result of this and was unable to concentrate on anything.</p>



<p>He traveled around Ahmedabad for comfort during this time and discovered that it seemed like a second home to him. His dream of pursuing an <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/nmims-ngasce-mba-programs-q/">MBA</a> from IIM had been destroyed, and he didn&#8217;t know what to do next. Finally, I settled on a job at McDonald&#8217;s. He began his career as a housekeeper. He was quickly promoted to kitchen crew and began taking orders and serving clients.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that he worked for a well-known company, he always wanted to accomplish more. The best approach to be independent and build your own personality is to start a business. He wanted to open a cafe, but he didn&#8217;t know how much it would cost. He abandoned the scheme because he lacked the necessary funds.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>MBA Chai Wala started with a bang.</strong></h2>



<p>Prafull decided to open a roadside tea stall after much deliberation. Despite the fact that this put him in danger, he wanted to pursue his aspirations. People generally look down on these types of enterprises. They are thought to be carried out by lower-class or less-educated individuals. Prafull, on the other hand, was unfazed. Praful&#8217;s only concern was what his father would think. He experienced several sleepless nights as a result of this. He began his first business as a tea staller near McDonald&#8217;s with a lot of courage and determination. On July 25, 2017, he began his firm with an investment of merely INR 8,000. He worked at McDonald&#8217;s from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and then at his tea stall in the evening.</p>



<p>When you have a small business, getting customers is difficult. A tea shop can be located on practically every street corner. Prafull served tea in earthen pots with toast and tissues to draw people in. He not only amused those who came to his stall, but he also approached those who were sitting in their automobiles. People were drawn to him because of his communication abilities and the distinctive method he served his meals.</p>



<p>The adjacent tea stall vendors became envious of his success as his customer base grew. They formed a union and expelled Prafulll from the area. Prafull was now more confident in his ability to succeed as a result of this. He made contact with the proprietor of a neighboring hospital and hired a location near the hospital. Prafull set up a new tea stall and restarted his business for INR 10,000. His unusual technique of serving tea captivated customers here as well. He eventually began selling snacks and coffee.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>His first restaurant</strong></h2>



<p>Prafull Billore opened his own restaurant, MBA Chaiwala, not long after. He explained that <a href="https://learningroutes.in/nmims-mba/">MBA</a> stands for &#8216;Mr. Billore Ahmedabad Chaiwala,&#8217; not Master of Business Administration. Within a few months, his company was generating millions of dollars per month. Prafull Billore also maintains a personal website and is the Facebook and Instagram manager for MBA Chaiwala. He is well-known among young people, particularly MBA students at IIM Ahemdabad. He&#8217;s also spoken at over 200 events, including women&#8217;s empowerment programs, entrepreneurship events, and more. On Valentine&#8217;s Day, he gave away free chai to single people. This went viral across all social media platforms, and he gained international prominence as a result.</p>



<p>He had a revenue of Rs 3 crore in the financial year 2019-20. Prafull adds, &#8220;My ambition is to sell tea all over the country and have every Indian consume my tea.&#8221; He runs a 300-square-foot restaurant with a staff of over 20 people.</p>



<p>Prafull&#8217;s experience teaches us that anything is achievable if you are focused, determined, and truly want to achieve your goals. Taking a risk in order to achieve something necessitates the guts to face the dread of the unknown. Regardless of the outcome, we learn to be more resilient and confident as a result of the experience.</p>

<p>Assignments like naming the business and making a logo are self-evident, however, shouldn&#8217;t something be said about the less-proclaimed, similarly significant stages? Regardless of whether it&#8217;s deciding your business structure or creating a definite promoting procedure, the responsibility can rapidly stack up. Maybe than wasting your time and speculating where to begin, follow this 10-venture agenda to change your business from a light over your head to a genuine substance.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Refine your thought-</strong> In case you&#8217;re contemplating beginning a business, you probably as of now have a thought of what you need to sell on the web, or possibly the market you need to enter. Do a speedy quest for existing organizations in your picked industry. Realize what current brand pioneers are doing and sort out how you can improve. If you figure your business can convey something different organizations don&#8217;t (or convey the same thing, just quicker and less expensive), or you have a strong thought and are prepared to make a marketable strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Characterize your &#8220;why&#8221;-</strong> In the expressions of Simon Sinek, &#8216;consistently start with why,'&#8221; Glenn Gutek, CEO of Awake Consulting and Coaching, disclosed to Business News Daily. &#8220;It is great to know why you are dispatching your business. In this cycle, it very well might be astute to separate between [whether] the business serves an individual why or a commercial center why. At the point when your why is centered around addressing a need in the commercial center, the extent of your business will consistently be bigger than a business that is intended to serve an individual need.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Consider diversifying &#8211;</strong>Another alternative is to open an establishment of a setup organization. The idea, brand following, and plan of action are as of now set up; all you need is a decent area and the necessary resources to support your activity. Conceptualize your business name-Despite which alternative you pick, comprehend the thinking behind your thought. Stephanie Desaulniers, proprietor of Business by Dezign and previous overseer of activities and ladies&#8217; business programs at Convention Center, alerts business people against composing a field-tested strategy or conceptualizing a business name before making sure about the thought&#8217;s worth.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Explain your objective clients-</strong> Desaulniers said over and over again individuals bounce into dispatching their business without investing energy to ponder who their clients will be and for what reason would need to purchase from them or recruit them. &#8220;You need to explain why you need to work with these clients – do you have an enthusiasm for making individuals&#8217; lives simpler?&#8221; Desaulniers said. &#8220;Or on the other hand appreciate making workmanship to carry tone to their reality? Recognizing these answers explains your central goal. Third, you need to characterize how you will offer this benefit to your clients and how to impart that worth such that they will pay.&#8221; During the ideation stage, you need to resolve the significant subtleties. If the thought isn&#8217;t something you&#8217;re energetic about or on the other hand in case there&#8217;s not a business opportunity for your creation, it very well may be an ideal opportunity to conceptualize different thoughts.</p>



<p><strong>Compose a marketable strategy</strong>&#8211; When you have your thought set up, you need to ask yourself a couple of significant inquiries: What is the motivation behind your business? Whom are you offering to? What are your ultimate objectives? How might you back your startup costs? These inquiries can be replied to in an elegantly composed strategy. A lot of mix-ups are made by new organizations hurrying into things without contemplating these parts of the business. You need to discover your objective client base. Who will purchase your item or administration? Assuming you can&#8217;t discover proof that there&#8217;s an interest in your thought, what might be the point?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lead statistical surveying</strong>&#8211; exhaustive statistical surveying on your field and the socioeconomics of potential customers is a significant piece of making a strategy. This includes directing reviews, holding centre gatherings, and exploring SEO and public information.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Statistical surveying assists you with understanding your objective client – their requirements, inclinations, and conduct – </strong>just as your industry and rivals. Numerous private company experts suggest gathering segment data and leading a cutthroat investigation to more readily get openings and constraints inside your market. The best private companies have items or administrations that are separated from the opposition. This essentially affects your serious scene and permits you to pass on novel worth to possible clients.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Think about a leave technique-</strong> It&#8217;s additionally a smart thought to consider a leave methodology as you incorporate your strategy. Creating some thought of how you&#8217;ll ultimately leave the business compels you to plan. &#8220;Time and again, new business visionaries are so amped up for their business thus sure everybody wherever will be a client that they give very little, assuming any, an ideal opportunity to show the arrangement on leaving the business,&#8221; said Josh Tolley, CEO of both Shyft Capital and Kavana.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;When you load up a plane, what is the main thing they show you? Instructions to get off of it. When you go out to see a film, what do they bring up before the element starts to play? Where the ways out are. Your first seven-day stretch of kindergarten, they line up every one of the children and show them fire drills to leave the structure. Too often I have seen business pioneers that don&#8217;t have three or four foreordained leave courses. This has prompted lower organization esteem and surprisingly obliterated family connections.&#8221; A field-tested strategy assists you with sorting out where your organization is going, how it will beat any likely hardships, and what you need to support it. At the point when you&#8217;re prepared to put pen to paper, these free layouts can help.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Survey your funds</strong>&#8211; Beginning any business has a cost, so you need to decide how you will take care of those expenses. Do you possess the ability to support your startup, or will you have to get cash? In case you&#8217;re intending to pass on your present place of employment to zero in on your business, do you have cash taken care of to help yourself until you make a benefit? It&#8217;s ideal to discover how much your startup costs will be. Numerous new companies fizzle since they run out of cash before making money. It&#8217;s never a poorly conceived notion to misjudge the measure of startup capital you need, as it tends to be some time before the business starts to acquire manageable income. Play out an equal initial investment examination- One way you can decide how much cash you need is to play out an equal initial investment examination. This is a fundamental component of monetary arranging that helps entrepreneurs decide when their organization, item, or administration will be productive. Watch your costs. Try not to overspend when beginning a business. Comprehend the sorts of buys that bode well for your business and try not to overspend on extravagant new gear that will not assist you with arriving at your business objectives. Screen your costs of doing business to guarantee you are remaining focused.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;A ton of new companies will in general burn through cash on pointless things,&#8221; said Jean Paldan, organizer and CEO of Rare Form New Media. &#8220;We worked with a startup that had two representatives however spent a gigantic sum on office space that would fit 20 individuals. They likewise rented an expert top-of-the-line printer that was more appropriate for a group of 100; it had key cards to follow who was printing what and when. Spend as little as conceivable when you start, and just on the things that are fundamental for the business to develop and be a triumph. Extravagances can come when you&#8217;re set up.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Develop your business-</strong> Your dispatch and first deals are just the start of your errand as a business visionary. To make a benefit and stay above water, you generally should be developing your business. It will require some investment and exertion, yet you&#8217;ll escape your business what you put into it. Working together with more settled brands in your industry is an extraordinary method to accomplish development. Connect with different organizations and request some advancement in return for a free item test or administration. Band together with a foundation association, and volunteer a portion of your time or items to get your name out there. While these tips will assist with dispatching your business and get you set to develop, there will never be an ideal arrangement. You need to ensure you get ready completely for beginning a business, however, things will very likely turn out badly. To maintain a fruitful business, you should adjust to evolving circumstances.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>&#8220;Be ready to change,&#8221; said Stephanie Murray, originator of Fiddlestix Party + Supply. &#8220;There&#8217;s an adage in the tactical that &#8216;no arrangement endures the primary contact,&#8217; implying that you can have the best arrangement on the planet, yet when it&#8217;s in real life, things change, and you must be prepared to adjust and issue address rapidly. As a business visionary, your worth lies in tackling issues, regardless of whether that is your item or administration taking care of issues for others or you taking care of issues inside your association.&#8221;</em></strong></p>

<p>For a successful entrepreneur, the ultimate goal is to take the business from conceptualization to market success. This, however, does not happen overnight, and requires a certain set of experiences, knowledge, skills, and traits. The entrepreneurial journey entails smart work coupled with great ambition, along with a willingness to fail and keep trying, ad infinitum, until the goal has been achieved. <strong>Grit is the number one personality trait of all successful entrepreneurs.</strong></p>



<p>No one is born with the inherent knowledge of what it takes to start and run a company. It is an ongoing, iterative experience that cannot be learned from a book. Amid a global slowdown due to the pandemic, and with competition intensifying in every industry, managing and growing a nascent entrepreneurial venture has become more complex than before.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>7 Steps to Becoming an Entrepreneur</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 1</strong>&#8211; <strong>Find the right business for you</strong></h3>



<p>Entrepreneurship is a broad term, and you can be an entrepreneur in just about any area. However, you will have to pick a field to work in and a business to start. Find a business that won’t only be successful, but is something that you are passionate about. Entrepreneurship is hard work, so you want to focus your attention on something you care about.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 2- Determine if you should get an education</strong></h3>



<p>You don’t need to have any type of formal education to be an entrepreneur, but that doesn’t mean you should ignore education entirely. If you want to start a tech company, experience in business, computer programming and marketing could all be valuable. Also, some industries will likely require some type of education, such as your own accounting or law firm.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 3- Plan your business</strong></h3>



<p>Before you begin your business, you need to have a business plan. A business plan lays out any objectives you have as well as your strategy for achieving those objectives. This plan is important for getting investors on board, as well as measuring how successful your business is.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 4- Find your target group/audience</strong></h3>



<p>Not every business appeals to everyone. The age, gender, income, race and culture of your target group will play a large role in determining where you open up shop – or if you even need to have a physical address for business. Research which group fits your business model best, and then gear everything to attract that demographic.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 5- Network</strong></h3>



<p>While networking is important in all fields, it may be most important for entrepreneurs. Networking is how you meet other people that might have skills you can use in your business. You can also find potential investors through networking to help get your business model off the ground. Your network can also support your business once you open, helping send new customers your way.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 6- Sell your idea</strong></h3>



<p>Consumers want products, but they don’t always know which product to pick. Your job as an entrepreneur is to convince people that whatever you’re selling is the best option available. You’ll have to find out what makes your product unique and then sell it based off the value it adds.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 7- Market</strong></h3>



<p>You should be focused on marketing before, during and after you start your business. You may have the best restaurant in the city, but nobody will visit if they don&#8217;t know it exists. Marketing is tricky, but if you should be able to focus your marketing efforts on your target audience. For example, millennials may be more likely to see an ad on social media than on a billboard downtown.</p>
