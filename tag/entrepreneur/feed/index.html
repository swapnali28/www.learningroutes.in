<p>For freshers aspiring to become entrepreneurs, pursuing an MBA can be a valuable tool in charting their path towards success. While embarking on the journey of entrepreneurship can be thrilling, it can also be a daunting prospect. In such circumstances, the advantages of an MBA programme can be instrumental in simplifying the process of becoming an entrepreneur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By equipping individuals with skills like business planning, marketing, strategy, and finance, an MBA provides them with the knowledge and tools they need to make critical decisions and run a successful venture.</p>



<p>While an MBA is not a mandatory requirement for success as an entrepreneur, it can offer several benefits. It helps individuals gain a deeper understanding of market trends, customer needs, and the overall business environment, allowing them to make more informed decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, an <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/nmims-distance-mba-admission-2022/">MBA</a> can provide individuals with a competitive edge over their peers, offering them the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in a highly competitive business landscape.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">6 Ways an MBA Can Make You a Better Entrepreneur</h1>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VeAsNvu18Qn1Sq7RKzbbM1UxTDhUGBT9z-wlyHJqV9eFw0qu-sZeVb-nNdmm1xlNc90Th9KMNKiS_OetvXEA4AC0EQqwOzN2O8y65lSryhwWKNBruTfo97A_OcE2e7y6zYPEsng2qXB-AsEXdZ03f14" alt="" width="595" height="293"/></figure>



<p>Running a business is a challenging journey that involves uncertainty, ambiguity, and risk. Navigating the business world can be difficult if you donâ€™t have a solid plan in mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, pursuing an MBA degree can provide you with a safe and reliable path to becoming a successful entrepreneur. In addition, an MBA programme can also provide you with the relevant knowledge and skills to manage a business effectively.</p>



<p>If you are confused, here are several ways in which an MBA degree can help individuals become better entrepreneurs:</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Learning Diverse Business Skills</strong></h3>



<p>As an entrepreneur, you will often find yourself juggling between various roles, such as CEO, Accountant, Marketer, and more. This is especially true for small business owners with limited resources to hire additional staff. For such individuals, pursuing an MBA can be a valuable way to develop a broad range of business skills to help them succeed in any role.</p>



<p>As an MBA programme covers various subjects, from accounting and finance to marketing and operations. Through the programme, you will learn various important skills including business strategy, organisational behaviour, and economics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, you will also get a chance to develop <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/7-skills-that-employers-want-to-see-in-fresh-graduates/">essential skills</a> like negotiation, public speaking, and teamwork. If you have a particular interest or passion, such as global management, you can specialise in that by pursuing an on-campus or online MBA programme in that field.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Fostering Global Perspective</strong></h3>



<p>With the rising popularity of business schools globally, pursuing an MBA degree offers an excellent opportunity to meet and interact with people from diverse cultural backgrounds. This can broaden one&#8217;s perspectives and foster a global mindset, essential in today&#8217;s interconnected world.</p>



<p>In addition, a global mindset also offers personal growth and financial benefits to organisations. According to a study, companies with an international outlook tend to perform better financially. In addition, they are better equipped to navigate cultural differences and build relationships with stakeholders worldwide.</p>



<p>As per World Economic Forum, by the year 2025, most of the global workforce will comprise millennials and Generation Z. As these generations value diversity and inclusion; therefore, businesses that prioritise these values can attract and retain top talent.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Learning Your Way</strong></h3>



<p>If you are an entrepreneur who values independence and innovation, pursuing an MBA could be a perfect choice. MBA programmes are designed to be flexible and accessible for busy working professionals, with online options available at affordable prices.</p>



<p>One of the key benefits of an MBA programme is the freedom and autonomy it provides. With a wide range of elective courses and opportunities to tailor your education to your unique interests and goals, you can focus on the areas of business that interest you the most.</p>



<p>Lastly, by enrolling in an MBA programme, you can combine your independent spirit with the knowledge and skills you need to succeed in business. So if you&#8217;re looking for a way to take your entrepreneurial ambitions to the next level, an MBA could be just what you need.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Expanding Your Network</strong></h3>



<p>Entrepreneurs know the importance of networking. In fact, their success often hinges on the strength of their connections. A robust network can provide fresh ideas, perspectives, and insights into new products, technologies, and business growth strategies.</p>



<p>An MBA programme offers access to like-minded and ambitious individuals who share your passion for business. Your classmates and professors can be valuable resources and sounding boards for ideas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, MBA programmes also organise networking events and career fairs, which enable students to connect with business leaders and potential employers. These events not only allow you to expand your network but also stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and practices.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Obtaining Leadership Skills</strong></h3>



<p>Becoming a successful entrepreneur is not just about having great ideas; it also involves leading a team towards success. Unfortunately, not everyone is a born leader, and 77% of businesses report a lack of leadership in their organisation. This is where pursuing an MBA programme can be beneficial for business owners, as it emphasises interpersonal skills development, which is essential for effective leadership.</p>



<p>MBA programmes offer courses in management, communication, and organisational behaviour that can give students a deeper understanding of what makes a great leader. Additionally, MBA students can put their leadership skills into practice through various projects and internships. For example, they may lead a team to complete a consulting project for a client or take up a leadership role in a student-run club or organisation. These experiences allow them to apply their learning in real-world situations and gain valuable feedback and insights.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Learning Risk Management</strong></h3>



<p>An MBA programme can be a game-changer for entrepreneurs when it comes to managing risks and making informed decisions. In the unpredictable business world, risks are inevitable, but an MBA programme can equip you with the skills to assess and manage them effectively.</p>



<p>While some entrepreneurs may rely on intuition, an MBA programme emphasises the importance of informed decision-making based on market analysis and data-driven insights. You will learn to identify the right factors, make calculated investments, and make strategic moves to propel your business forward.</p>



<p>In short, pursuing an MBA can give you the superpowers you need to navigate the challenges of the business world with confidence and make decisions that will help you stay ahead of the competition.</p>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Top MBA Programmes for Entrepreneurs</h2>



<p>If you are planning on running your own business but are not sure about which MBA programme to opt for; the following list will help you clear your doubts.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Post Graduate Programme in Management (PGP)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>MBA in Entrepreneurship &amp; Family Business&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>MBA (Entrepreneurship)&nbsp;</td><td>MBA (Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>MBA in Sales Leadership</td><td>MBA in Product Management</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Entrepreneurs wondering whether pursuing an MBA is worth it should know that the answer is a resounding &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The benefits that an MBA can provide, such as networking opportunities, exposure to diverse perspectives, leadership training, and access to experienced mentors, are invaluable for entrepreneurs as they pitch their ideas, plan new ventures, and develop strategies for funding and growth. In some cases, entrepreneurs may forge new paths and create business models for which no established benchmarks exist. As an entrepreneur with an MBA, you will be better equipped to navigate the challenges of breaking new ground and to overcome the naysayers who claim, &#8220;It has never been done that way before.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Can you drive a car if you have no clue about the breaks or clutch? Can you cook without a recipe? If your answer to these questions is no, how can you think of running a whole business without having a relevant qualification when you cannot do the basic tasks without learning them.</p>



<p>You may get inspired by all the college dropouts who turned into successful businessmen and might consider doing the same. It sounds encouraging that a person reached to million dollars worth from nothing, but unfortunately, the reality is different, and there is more to the truth than you can see. You can not undervalue a degree based on a few examples. To run a company, knowledge and skills are required, which you can learn only after investing your time in studying.</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Here are ten reasons you should give value to an MBA before entering into Entrepreneurship</strong>.</h3>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Creates Network- To support your firm</strong></h4>



<p>For any company to flourish, the main requirement is customers, stakeholders, suppliers, and employees. In other words, people who buy your product and help you create the product are your assets. Now, How to build that asset? Connections are your answer. Making trusting connections with all the people you rely upon is a crucial component of entrepreneurship. Therefore, the success of entrepreneurs depends on developing relationships before they launch.</p>



<p>Through a professional degree, you learn to build a support network through your study. An MBA will help you here. It will allow you to connect with like-minded people and build friendships across industries. You have access to an alumni network as well. They frequently interact with each other and people who are in their contact. They could be able to put you in touch with someone who can advance your company. In your initial days, when you are working on starting your venture, your network will assist you. You can quickly get helped with seed funding and expertise based on your link.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Adds value- By building trust in your clients</strong></h4>



<p>Your potential customer knows how prestigious an MBA degree is, and they know its value. Owing to that, they will consider you a trustworthy person as MBA is a prestigious degree and is widely regarded as a mark of corporate excellence. Such credibility will lead to an increase in your worth. Therefore, they will be much more likely to listen and take your advice seriously when they receive it. Hence, earning a general master&#8217;s degree in business administration will enhance your business sharpness and get the respect of clients.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Education- Expansion in Knowledge&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>You will gain knowledge about managing investments, raising capital, and starting (and running) a firm, from LLCs to non-profits. Such kind of knowledge is priceless because it saves you the time and effort it would take you to figure everything out on your own.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. More strategic approach- So that your people can align with your vision</strong></h4>



<p>The most crucial conversation at a start-up is the strategic one. It clarifies a company&#8217;s priorities, shapes its direction, and makes it easier for everyone to work toward the same objectives. It is also the most challenging talk to make when starting a company. This is because it expects founders to describe their vision clearly so its staff can work accordingly. Additionally, they must make challenging trade-offs between immediate requirements and long-term expansion.</p>



<p>Comparable to building a house without the right tools is attempting to excel at strategic dialogues without attending business school. You can do it, but it will be significantly more challenging, and you&#8217;ll inevitably make some costly errors.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/fZsHJ2JhrCmK9W79sbhZ-i3CsGPQR3NtP7tJ6QWNMz7xz8x5AASjVjAJ0kSiLOjIlLpU-27xBeqEPaaRklbU2yzJWTT4Ts6aNwmLn-VD4EHbUYkVZc8w2CKHOx3aH5cI0oviFgQ1q0YFFwp_s9Xdjq8" alt=""/></figure>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Mentorship- Makes you better</strong></h4>



<p>If you are doing a degree, you undergo a lot of hardships dealing with the people training you. They will put you in all kinds of situations to become the best version of yourself in terms of management, analytical skills, leadership qualities, etc. You can lose this opportunity of polishing up if you do not choose to do a degree and start working without it.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Bigger Perspective- The ability to think globally</strong></h4>



<p>Students come to business schools from all around the world. This implies that the group of people you will join will contribute a variety of thoughts and opinions to business operations and other situations. You will develop a global mentality and a thorough awareness of global trends and market dynamics as you stay in their company.</p>



<p>When it is said the ability to think globally, &nbsp;it means the skill to work comfortably with professionals from different walks of life, and this is highly encouraged by UK Centre for Economics and Business. So, doing an MBA will help you get these much-needed visions for your company.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>7. Smartness-To keep you up with the alterations</strong></h4>



<p>The market in which you will deal keeps on changing. Every day there are new concepts, working techniques, and expansions in different areas. Being an MBA student will provide you with the technical knowledge necessary to make profitable and wise decisions according to the changes coming in the industry. You will learn to manage risk assessment, do precise cost-benefit evaluations, and many more.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>8. Increase in Leadership qualities-Transform your ideas</strong></h4>



<p>Any group working together for running a firm never has a shortage of ideas.</p>



<p>What matters more than ideas is the appropriate execution of them so that they can turn into a successful reality. Such work can only be done by or under a great leader. If you enroll in a Master&#8217;s course, you will be able to learn how to improve your leadership abilities along with several practical money management techniques.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>9. Contests- Pre-preparation for future</strong></h4>



<p>Top Business Schools usually organize competitions among the students as a part of their activities to evaluate their ideas and encourage them. A contest is held where each participant comes up with their start-up idea, and the one with the most important business strategy wins. So, you can always consider it a &#8220;practice run&#8221; for creating a company that will generate significant revenues.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>10 Mandatory tricks- To scale your business</strong></h4>



<p>If you want your firm to do wonders, it is crucial for you to understand how to expand it. There is a huge difference between handling a small business and one which has hundreds of employees. As your revenue grows, it&#8217;s important to understand how to do the appropriate hiring, how to align your team with your vision, and how to engage your staff in your goals. An <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/nmims-distance-mba/">MBA</a> will help to inculcate the skills required to upscale your start-up as you will get familiar with the subjects like operations management, finance, and market strategies.</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="has-text-align-left wp-block-heading"><strong>Here is a table with Top MBA courses that can be beneficial for running a&nbsp;company</strong></h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>You can achieve everything you set your mind to if you believe in yourself. There are no limitations out here, and the only ones you set are for yourself. MBA Chai Wala&#8217;s owner, Prafull Billore, was determined to pursue his dreams and succeeded. He had his share of setbacks, but he overcame them to get to where he is now. His success story serves as an encouragement to today&#8217;s kids.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>His upbringing and challenges</strong></h2>



<p>Prafull intended to get his master&#8217;s degree from IIM Ahmedabad before launching his own eatery. You must take the CAT in order to be accepted into a <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/nmims-ngasce/">good MBA program</a>. The CAT is regarded as one of the most demanding exams available. Prafull studied for over 10 hours a day to achieve his objectives. His parents wished him well and hoped he would pass his examinations. Unfortunately, he failed the CAT exam three times out of three attempts. Despite his failure, his parents continued to support him. Prafull became depressed as a result of this and was unable to concentrate on anything.</p>



<p>He traveled around Ahmedabad for comfort during this time and discovered that it seemed like a second home to him. His dream of pursuing an <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/nmims-ngasce-mba-programs-q/">MBA</a> from IIM had been destroyed, and he didn&#8217;t know what to do next. Finally, I settled on a job at McDonald&#8217;s. He began his career as a housekeeper. He was quickly promoted to kitchen crew and began taking orders and serving clients.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that he worked for a well-known company, he always wanted to accomplish more. The best approach to be independent and build your own personality is to start a business. He wanted to open a cafe, but he didn&#8217;t know how much it would cost. He abandoned the scheme because he lacked the necessary funds.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>MBA Chai Wala started with a bang.</strong></h2>



<p>Prafull decided to open a roadside tea stall after much deliberation. Despite the fact that this put him in danger, he wanted to pursue his aspirations. People generally look down on these types of enterprises. They are thought to be carried out by lower-class or less-educated individuals. Prafull, on the other hand, was unfazed. Praful&#8217;s only concern was what his father would think. He experienced several sleepless nights as a result of this. He began his first business as a tea staller near McDonald&#8217;s with a lot of courage and determination. On July 25, 2017, he began his firm with an investment of merely INR 8,000. He worked at McDonald&#8217;s from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and then at his tea stall in the evening.</p>



<p>When you have a small business, getting customers is difficult. A tea shop can be located on practically every street corner. Prafull served tea in earthen pots with toast and tissues to draw people in. He not only amused those who came to his stall, but he also approached those who were sitting in their automobiles. People were drawn to him because of his communication abilities and the distinctive method he served his meals.</p>



<p>The adjacent tea stall vendors became envious of his success as his customer base grew. They formed a union and expelled Prafulll from the area. Prafull was now more confident in his ability to succeed as a result of this. He made contact with the proprietor of a neighboring hospital and hired a location near the hospital. Prafull set up a new tea stall and restarted his business for INR 10,000. His unusual technique of serving tea captivated customers here as well. He eventually began selling snacks and coffee.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>His first restaurant</strong></h2>



<p>Prafull Billore opened his own restaurant, MBA Chaiwala, not long after. He explained that <a href="https://learningroutes.in/nmims-mba/">MBA</a> stands for &#8216;Mr. Billore Ahmedabad Chaiwala,&#8217; not Master of Business Administration. Within a few months, his company was generating millions of dollars per month. Prafull Billore also maintains a personal website and is the Facebook and Instagram manager for MBA Chaiwala. He is well-known among young people, particularly MBA students at IIM Ahemdabad. He&#8217;s also spoken at over 200 events, including women&#8217;s empowerment programs, entrepreneurship events, and more. On Valentine&#8217;s Day, he gave away free chai to single people. This went viral across all social media platforms, and he gained international prominence as a result.</p>



<p>He had a revenue of Rs 3 crore in the financial year 2019-20. Prafull adds, &#8220;My ambition is to sell tea all over the country and have every Indian consume my tea.&#8221; He runs a 300-square-foot restaurant with a staff of over 20 people.</p>



<p>Prafull&#8217;s experience teaches us that anything is achievable if you are focused, determined, and truly want to achieve your goals. Taking a risk in order to achieve something necessitates the guts to face the dread of the unknown. Regardless of the outcome, we learn to be more resilient and confident as a result of the experience.</p>
