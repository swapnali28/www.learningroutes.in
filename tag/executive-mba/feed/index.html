<p>In this dynamic era of digitalisation and innovation, most of us are continuously aiming to improve our skills and enhance our knowledge. The best way to do this for working professionals and corporate employees is by earning an Executive MBA degree which helps them to learn advanced management concepts and real-world applications, brush &amp; learn new skills as well as keep up with the pace of development at their workplace. This programme caters to build great networking opportunities with high-level executives from a variety of industries.</p>



<p>An <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/nmims-executive-mba-wx-programs/">Executive MBA</a> or an EMBA holds a lot of similarities with a regular MBA degree, but is basically designed keeping in mind the unique needs of working professionals, business leaders and corporate employees who aim to improve their knowledge while they are still employed. An EMBA programme provides a comprehensive view of the organisation to its students, guides them to deal with the complex structures of the organisation and inculcates in them a deeper know-how of the business processes. </p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Eligibility Criteria</strong></h3>



<p>In order to pursue an EMBA, the person should be eligible as per the requirements. The admissibility for the same can be discussed as follows: <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>The individual who wants to do an EMBA should have a graduation degree or a master’s degree from a recognised institution. He should possess a minimum of 50% in his highest qualification. The minimum marks required vary from university to university.&nbsp;</li><li>He should have adequate work experience which is generally around 2-3 years.&nbsp;</li><li>The candidate should have excellent communication skills and should be proficient in the English language.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>*Note: Most universities don’t go for entrance exams, however, it depends on the university whether or not an entrance exam is required.</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Course Duration</strong></h3>



<p>It takes around 24 months to complete a distance EMBA program which has about 4 terms or semesters. However, the duration for a distance Executive MBA varies for different institutes. In some universities, it lasts for a year while in others, the course is of a 2-year duration. </p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fee Structure</strong></h3>



<p>The course fee varies depending on the college, duration of the course and many other factors. However, the average fee ranges from INR 50,000 to INR 5 lac for the entire course. Candidates have the option to pay the fees in instalments which makes it manageable. There are also many universities and B- schools that conduct various scholarship tests to make the course more economical. </p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Executive MBA: Specially Crafted for Working Professionals</strong></h3>



<p>Working professionals who are looking to upgrade their career are likely to pursue this course. The course certainly adds value to their career by updating them with the latest happenings in the industry and bringing them the opportunity to acquire relevant leadership skills. Moreover, they can pursue this course while continuing to work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thus, distance EMBA is an ideal course for professionals as it helps them develop entrepreneurial as well as managerial skills which are an inseparable part of any business or organisation. Apart from this, an EMBA course would help students gain thorough knowledge about different areas of management such as HR Management, Finance, International Business, Business Analytics, Operations &amp; Supply Chain, Leadership &amp; Strategy, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides knowledge, the individuals who pursue an EMBA also get adequate opportunities to develop excellent communication skills, strategic thinking abilities, analytical skills, decision making skills, leadership qualities, etc. Therefore, a distance learning EMBA program not only increases the theoretical knowledge of candidates but also provides an intensive practical experience of the real-time business world. </p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Distance EMBA vs Regular MBA</strong></h3>



<p>Both regular MBA and distance EMBA are quite similar but there are certain distinctions which make them different from each other. So, here are some key differences between the two:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Flexibility</strong>: </h4>



<p>In a distance EMBA course, the aspirants have a flexible learning schedule, self-paced learning and the advantage of learning while doing work. On the other hand, in the case of a regular MBA, one has to be physically present in the classes. </p>



<div style="height:2px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Course Duration:</strong></h4>



<p>A distance EMBA course can have a comparatively shorter duration as compared to a regular MBA programme. </p>



<div style="height:2px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Work Experience:</strong></h4>



<p>An adequate work experience of around 2-5 years is a prerequisite for pursuing a distance EMBA course. While for a regular MBA degree work experience may or may not be a necessary precondition.</p>



<div style="height:2px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. <strong>Fee Structure:</strong></h4>



<p>A distance EMBA course has comparatively less fees as compared to a regular MBA course.</p>



<div style="height:2px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. <strong>On the basis of Learning:</strong></h4>



<p>The curriculum of a regular MBA is covered by highly educated and skilled professors who hold expertise in their fields. But, in an EMBA the aspirants are taught by professors who have intensive knowledge about their specialisation and industry experts who provide them with real-time business world experiences. Moreover, the EMBA curriculum is more practical-oriented as compared to a regular MBA.</p>



<p>Therefore, an EMBA is a course that is an ideal choice for working professionals which will help them to enhance their skills and knowledge, while they are at work. Whereas, a regular MBA is for students who are willing to attend regular classes for doing an MBA programme.</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Salary Expectations</strong></h3>



<p>EMBA is one of the most premiere courses around the globe and provides you with innumerable job opportunities and high designations with higher salaries. The remuneration criteria vary depending upon a lot of factors.</p>



<p>The average salary packages of different EMBA courses can be classified as follows:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Brand Manager- INR 14 Lac per annum</li><li>Operations Director- INR 30 Lac per annum</li><li>Senior Accountant- INR 4 Lac per annum</li><li>HR Executive- INR 5 Lac per annum</li></ul>



<p>Apart from these, aspirants get a chance to work in various reputed job profiles such as Senior Business Analyst, Management Consultant, Business Development Manager, Brand Manager, etc. These job profiles provide you with a great learning experience and increase your horizons in the business world. Additionally, the perks and emoluments they offer are huge, both in quantitative as well as qualitative aspects. </p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Takeaway&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>An EMBA would be a great opportunity for aspirants who don&#8217;t want to be stagnant in their careers and want continuous growth in their personal as well as professional lives. The course offers a greater understanding of the curriculum and thorough knowledge of the real business world which would help you to achieve greater milestones in your professional life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>According to a poll conducted by the <strong>Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC)</strong>, <strong>19% of applicants in India now choose to apply to an Executive MBA program over a conventional MBA program. </strong>India was also ranked second globally in a <strong>2018 GMAC</strong> study of prospective MBA students. Nearly 14 percent of B-School applicants selected India as their top preference.</p>



<p>The <strong>Indian School of Business was the first institution to offer an Executive MBA in India</strong>, and the IIMs shortly followed with added benefits. These MBA programs are created with working professionals, executives, high-end managers, and CEOs in mind. Industry managers, professionals, and executives can develop their abilities by following the curriculum.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:12px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the difference between a distance MBA and an executive MBA?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Aspirants generally misunderstand a distance executive MBA course as any other distance MBA. Here are <strong>3 key differences</strong> between the two: &#8211;&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>The duration of an executive MBA is a minimum of 1 year and can be exceeded to as many years as the university wants but on the other hand distance MBA is restricted to 2 years.&nbsp;</li><li>An executive course is a general managerial course and very rarely any specialization is included but it is common in the case of distance courses to include specializations. Institutes like Narsee Monjee offer 10 industry-oriented specializations.&nbsp;</li><li>The main aim of an executive MBA is to expand the network rather than prioritize the placement opportunities but the latter is chosen so as to offer placement assistance which is its main USP.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<div style="height:12px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Advantages of an online Executive MBA course: &#8211;</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Online Courses &#8211; an opportunity to multitask&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>The biggest advantage of online courses is that students can do simultaneous things along with their courses. Working professionals are especially inclined towards such courses. <strong>Reports have suggested that in the year 2020, the online education market was reported to be INR 91.41 billion</strong> big.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Sponsored by MNCs</strong></h4>



<p>Not a lot of people are aware of the fact that, if a working professional wants to pursue an executive course their company either offers to pay them for the course or gives them a sabbatical thus helping them to upskill and take higher and responsible roles.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Pursuing Benefits&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Not only the course is beneficial after completion, but aspirants also get promotions just because they are taking such a course from top business schools in India. In such cases the aspirants get threefold benefits: &#8211;&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Promotion based on pursuing the course&nbsp;</li><li>Upskilled both professionals and academically&nbsp;</li><li>Promotions after course completion&nbsp;</li></ol>



<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Practical Implementation</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The main purpose of a distance executive program is to inculcate managerial and entrepreneurial skills. This course trains individuals to aim for higher positions in their organizations. The curriculum of an executive course is embedded with case studies, interactive courses, and add-ons. Such diverse methods help the students to learn these skills and also apply them simultaneously in their current job roles.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Easy Admission Procedure&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Surprisingly, as much as this course is a value addition <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in">enrollment in online courses</a> is also easy. Institutes like Narsee Monjee take interviews to enrol students in their executive programs. There are no entrance exams or marks barriers, the admissions are based on experience, knowledge, and personality check.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Less Fee but More Value&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>As compared to a regular course, an online executive course is highly beneficial because the fee structure of a regular course begins with 8 lakhs but an online course can be completed in half the amount that too from India’s top B-School.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:12px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">List of Skills developed in an online Executive Course</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Ethics and Social Responsibility</td><td>Decision Making</td><td>Networking&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Soft Skills&nbsp;</td><td>Communication&nbsp;</td><td>Leadership and Teamwork&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Investment management</td><td>Business research</td><td>Strategic brand management</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<div style="height:12px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Disadvantages of an online Executive MBA course: &#8211;</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Lack of Time Management</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>An executive program is a hefty course irrespective of the mode of education and thus requires time, effort, and devotion. To succeed in online learning, students must find a method to combine the freedom of the medium with a strict and realistic timetable.</p>



<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Non &#8211; Seriousness&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Since admission to these courses is comparatively easy hence the students may take it for granted. The flexibility and convenience of online classes might be advantageous for self-disciplined students, but for those who lack motivation or discipline, the absence of a formal framework can be a trap. You don&#8217;t have a set meeting time, and you don&#8217;t connect with professors and classmates on a regular basis in a way that might push you to work better. Lack of self-discipline among online students can result in missed deadlines for assignments, inadequate preparation for exams, and failure to take the initiative to contact professors by phone or email, all of which can negatively affect their academic performance.</p>



<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>International Opportunities&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Institutes like ISB offer international opportunities but that is only for the students who have enrolled for regular courses. The biggest disadvantage of online courses is that institutes can not offer them direct placement assistance due to UGC guidelines hence the students lack international placement opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. <strong>Students are always mentally occupied</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Establishing boundaries is a difficult task especially when everything is online. To make a transition between online classes and online pleasure time is difficult because of excess dopamine release. This does not allow the brain to process and slow down things and also makes a severe impact on the eyes. However flexible and convenient online education might be but it takes a toll on the individual’s health.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1K2aXypTbuCBz1hPMUk08ZpvofwWdfhmG7NqLJ8pVapdEa_t9MLwAlqIOns1dRe8LJSn1GKWU6xp7ugYgSgeV3d3MCUUhViPNLsK15neXrmtlCPJu7mA_SOo0qP5Tub5Bb-o2EDmz7P_gTfOHw" alt="Benefits of Executive MBA"/></figure>



<p>A research conducted by <strong>Pew Research Center research in August 2011, 77% of college supervisors said their institutions provided online courses.</strong> The demand from students and the benefits for colleges in providing online education has helped the E-learning industry expand. Nevertheless, despite its benefits, some of the learning downsides might be difficult for students to deal with if they lack the appropriate online learning abilities.</p>
