To avoid such unnecessary problems and misunderstandings as occurred between Michael Scott and his squad, clear communication is vital to the growth and sustenance of a business. Clear and effective communication helps deliver a strong message to employees as well as the customer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Communication acts as a catalyst for the growth of the organisation as well as you; as an employee, manager, or business owner. Many times, effective communication has been proven to be vital for the sustenance of a business. Recent research by a US-based company called GARTNER found that almost 70% of an organisation&#8217;s mistakes are caused by the lack of communication. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the top reasons to understand the importance of communication in an organisation:</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<p>There is a common misconception that communication only takes place verbally. However, communication is the fusion of verbal, and non-verbal communication, gestures, body language, and many other factors. Therefore, in order to be an effective communicator, one must work on both verbal and written communication as well as overall personality development. Learning better communication helps you increase your and your business&#8217;s productivity and help you excel in your career.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Body Language&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Through our bad habits or bad posture, our body language falls behind while communicating. The first impression is the last impression and that extends to your first stance. Wrong body language can deliver a wrong perception of the speaker. Therefore, to improve your communication skills, you must focus on your body language. Exhibiting good body language is also an important<a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/job-interview-etiquettes-10-tips-to-impress-employers/"> job interview etiquette</a>.</p>

<p>In order to become good at communication, you must be a very good listener. While communicating, always try to understand what other people are trying to say and answer accordingly. </p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Practice Gestures&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>9. Maintain Eye Contact</strong></h4>



<p>During a conversation or presentation, try to maintain eye contact with the other person for 4-5 seconds before looking at them. Also, using natural hand gestures while speaking can help you feel more confident.</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>10. Ask questions</strong></h4>



<p>To be an active listener, you need to ask relevant questions or repeat parts of the conversation to show that you understand the point. Listening makes communication more effective and asking a question at each and every point helps you improve your communication skills. </p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Takeaway</strong></h3>



<p>Undeniably, it&#8217;s imperative to communicate effectively in the workplace. Being a good communicator goes a long way.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On January 5, 2023, the University Grants Commission (UGC) released a draft stating that India is officially open to welcoming foreign universities in the country. This will transform India’s approach to higher education and benefit the students incredibly. But it also raises many questions. How will the government safeguard the interest of our country? Why did this draft not get approval in the previous years? Will foreign universities be given complete autonomy? Are these universities willing to hire Indian professors &amp; teachers? And what does the future of India&#8217;s higher education look like?&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s This Noise About Foreign Universities Entering the Indian Market?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>According to the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/foreign-universities-india-campus-8366318/">UGC report</a>, many <strong>“European Countries”</strong> are interested in expanding their roots in India. The <strong>University of Birmingham</strong> released an official response which said, <em>“We are always open to opportunities for partnership working. We would also point Indian students toward the excellent study opportunities available at the University of Birmingham in both UK and Dubai.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Another college that is<strong> King’s College, London has signed MoU with the government of Telangana</strong> for collaborative research, staff &amp; student exchange, curriculum development, and upskilling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These collaborations and the keen interest of foreign universities in Indian institutions is a testimony to the fact that India is an excellent economy to invest in.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Attracts Foreign Investment in India?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Studies have shown that after the United States, India currently has the second-largest higher education system. Thus, the education sector in our nation has a very high potential for growth. The market for distance education was valued at 39 billion in 2018, and by 2024, it is expected to rise to 360 billion. By the end of 2020, there were more than 988 universities and about 40,000 colleges already established in India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the AISHE stats, the gross enrollment ratio has grown by 0.8%, with a constant increase of 18.2% in female enrollments. This level of growth necessitates significant financial commitment which is not feasible simply through the government. As a result, it encourages and supports investments from the private sector. Furthermore, it promotes foreign direct investment in the sector.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The NEP 2020 Vision</strong></h3>



<p>The latest UGC draft is in line with National Education Policy 2020 (NEP). NEP envisioned the internationalisation of higher education and stated its vision that “top universities in the world will be facilitated to operate in India.” It reflects that the government has thoughtfully taken this action to attract foreign investment in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The UGC Draft</strong></h3>



<p>The draft was announced by the UGC Chairman, Dr. M Jagadesh Kumar which laid down the following key points:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>The universities that are among the top 500 in QS Ranking in the overall category or subject-wise category are eligible to apply in India&nbsp;</li><li>If the universities do not participate in such rankings then they must be reputable in their country</li><li>The foreign university can decide its fee structure, hiring process, admission process, and the Indian government will not have any say in such matters</li><li>The foreign universities can repatriate to their parent university</li><li>The courses offered by these universities should not be against the interest of India’s interests and beliefs&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/MBVi5iFH67Jf8Cca-cvAU0_vVFmExVvYT-2gTEaS7VXX2-UrI_dDWWVyvYT8igVH82QKH0x_8oydlUXJZdwjYNahMV-OiS7n277XKRb7fJTI9HiYE8jOg4jsXs4jUMS5_zs4AOSZrDcX3Vm2RGP20HkLjTjqIMd25Esy59svpFoVfOpeQ_QqbO43Z9IUXQ" alt="" width="737" height="366"/></figure></div>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Have Foreign Universities Received Complete Autonomy?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>According to the official draft, the Indian government will not interfere in matters of foreign universities. They have been given the freedom to set their fee structure for both Indian and international students.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They are also not obligated to follow the reservation system that is popular in India otherwise. Additionally, they can also follow their own process for hiring.</p>



<p>Although the draft did mention that they are advised to include scholarships by Foreign Higher Educational Institution (FHEI). Furthermore, the government has said that the fee structure should be “transparent and reasonable.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ceqTzQgRDlFO6mZvTJwPEKEErLV6Xp7fUCLs9JIDlRerhsFmkPpZri0-DH4lJE8MvBvAYDbykidWTSXb2EvyINaEcP_BpIlGppZdViEecqn6tdAXCPBn6-4_iENeY_jmAgJjiMdVMvCgp9s1bhIVX8Gym4TJm1qVFHWJfVvIgEiG-MMNhzvtRjKQ_QpgJQ" alt="" width="400" height="319"/></figure></div>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How does the Government Safeguard Indian Interests?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The UGC has set the following parameters to safeguard the Indian national interests:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>The UGC can examine the university campuses at any time&nbsp;</li><li>The universities have to abide by India’s anti-ragging and other criminal law policies</li><li>The UGC can suspend or withdraw the university’s approval if its actions are against the policies of India</li><li>The foreign universities have to submit an audit and annual report stating that their working is in line with Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999</li></ol>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How is It Beneficial?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“Presence of Foreign Higher Education Institutions here will enable Indian students obtain foreign qualifications at affordable cost, and make India an attractive study destination.”</em></p><cite>M Jagadesh Kumar, UGC Chairperson&nbsp;</cite></blockquote>



<p></p>



<p>Although it is too early to say anything but majorly the benefits that can be seen of foreign university entering higher education sector in India are:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Foreign students will invest in the courses. Thus, it will directly contribute the country’s GDP</li><li>In order to compete with these universities, IITs, IIMs, private universities will also make necessary changes in their curriculum, opportunities and other procedures</li><li>It is easier for Indian students to study in their dream universities yet stay in the country</li><li>It will also reduce visa and other immigration issues&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>This is broadly what the new UGC policy looks like and in the coming future we will unfold more information. Till then visit our page for more updates.</p>

<div style="height:7px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the Scenario of the Job Market in 2023?</strong></h3>



<p>The job market is bound to change constantly due to the changing needs and technology in the world and thus, it becomes difficult to figure out how to prepare for a job at the right time. There was a tremendous change in the job market during and post-pandemic as there were a great number of layoffs, shortage of jobs, and an increased unemployment rate. But the post-pandemic era also lured us with newer jobs and changing work trends like working from home was the “new normal” and till date many companies encourage it. But as we are reaching the end of 2022, what will be the scenario of jobs in 2023?</p>



<p><strong>As of 2022, many new employment opportunities in the IT, real estate and health sectors are seen with the IT sector leading the race. FY2022 recorded a 15.5% growth which was the highest ever, reaching USD 270 billion in revenue. It is also seen as a year of tech startups. </strong>A trend that will definitely see a significant boost in 2023 is a shift from theoretical knowledge to a focus on soft skills. An employer would likely hire somebody who can crack that code, build a strong strategy or create amazing graphics. Employers will tend to seek employees who have strong communication skills, problem-solving abilities and team-building abilities because these qualities reflect adaptability and flexibility in an ever-changing workplace. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5 Tips to Become Job Ready in the Changing Job Market:</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Understanding the Current Job Market and Trends</strong></h4>



<p>Since the job market is bound to evolve with changing times, it becomes crucial to stay up-to-date with the changing trends. Hence, research plays a very important role when it comes to understanding the job market. For instance, it helps to understand which trend might last more than 10 years. One such example is:  post-pandemic people started preferring remote or work from home and this trend is likely to persist in the coming years. There are even more diverse modes of work emerging such as freelancing, contract projects and much more. Many people are finding self-employment to be a better option than working from the office. It, therefore, becomes obvious that the current job market demands you to be flexible at work and tech-savvy. </p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Explore Newly Evolving Fields</strong></h4>



<p>India has a mixed economy which makes it an attractive country for many diverse job sectors. But, it was seen that India’s economy was sick before the coronavirus crisis and it went even more down during the pandemic. The pandemic also brought about the scenario of online systems and the boost in sectors like digital marketing which is evolving drastically and thereby is creating newer job opportunities.

According to Business Standards, “Two-thirds<strong> of Indian knowledge workers are likely to switch jobs in 2023.” </strong>Additionally, studies have also shown that Indian<strong> gaming will add up to 1 lakh jobs in the year 2023. </strong></p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. <strong>Gain Experience</strong></h4>



<p>Employers would definitely prefer to hire an experienced person but that does not mean that freshers can never land a job.
