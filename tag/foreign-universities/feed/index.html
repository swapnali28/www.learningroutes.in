										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Around 2,000 years ago, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/nalanda-lok-sabha-election-results/">Nalanda</a>, Vikramshila, Vallabhi and Takshashila gave us gems like Chanakya, Brahmgupta, Bhaskaracharya, Aryabhatta and others. These great scholars have given the world the fundamentals of Mathematics, Science, Humanity, Morality, Human Behaviour or any other field that you can name. Due to this, India has gained attraction and acceptance from around the world in the field of knowledge and education. But over the period of time, we lost the leading role in the education sector. This is because of the change in the political scenery of the country, numerous invasions or perhaps many other factors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp; National Education Policy 2020 has given the roadmap so that India can regain the status of “King of the Education Sector” position and once again become a global leader. Thus, it has kept the principle of “Internationalisation of Higher Education” at the core. In line with the same, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has introduced a new regulation that allows <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/foreign-universities-soon-to-open-campus-in-india/">foreign universities</a> to set up campuses in India, thus, encouraging foreign investment in the sector.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Does the New Regulation Say?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>On January 5, 2023, the UGC released a draft stating that Foreign Universities are officially welcome to open campuses in India. The draft laid down some ground rules for them to become a Partner University. These are:</p>



<ol><li>The universities that are among the top 500 in QS Ranking in the overall category or subject-wise category are eligible to apply in India&nbsp;</li><li>If the universities do not participate in such rankings, then they must be reputable in their country</li><li>The foreign university can decide its fee structure, hiring process, admission process, and the Indian government will not have any say in such matters</li><li>The foreign universities can repatriate to their parent university</li><li>The courses offered by these universities should not be against India’s national interests and beliefs&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>The universities can only offer offline classes. The UGC regulation has completely ruled out online classes.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;Additionally, the UGC has given the following privileges to foreign universities:&nbsp;</h5>



<ol><li>Autonomy&nbsp;</li><li>Can set their own Fee &amp; Admission Process&nbsp;</li><li>Can have their own Hiring Process&nbsp;</li><li>Have the liberty to Repatriate to their parent&nbsp;</li></ol>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is This Reform Supposed to Achieve?</strong></h3>



<p>The reform was introduced to attract and encourage foreign investment in the education sector. Thus, it will aid in the development of the education industry in India while also contributing significantly to the country’s GDP. Furthermore, it will encourage national universities to update their curriculum and adopt advanced pedagogy in order to stay in competition with the incoming foreign universities. This will encourage innovation and promote infrastructural development in national universities like IITs, IIMs and private universities.</p>



<p>The move will not only benefit the education sector but will also make a positive impact on other sectors. For instance, it will decrease the mobility of young human resources outside the country. It will also reduce the underlying visa and other immigration issues in the country.</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Foreign Universities in India: A Breakthrough or a Gimmick&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>This is not the first time that talks around bringing foreign universities to the country have been making circles. In the year 1995, soon after the establishment of the World Trade Organization, a bill was introduced in the parliament to allow foreign universities to build homes in India. Then again, during 2005-06, a similar proposal was initiated during the first term of the United Progressive Alliance, but it got rejected. Another bill was introduced in 2010 during the second term of the UPA government. That too lapsed eventually.</p>



<p>Finally, in the year 2023, the UGC has successfully released this draft. But, it comes with many questions. First and foremost, whether or not this is a good reform?&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“Two-thirds of India’s universities and 90% of colleges lack quality education, Political backing was required from the top rank of Vice-Chancellor to many other university appointments. Favouritism and corruption exist.”&nbsp;</em></p><cite>Manmohan Singh, the then-Prime Minister (speech 2007)</cite></blockquote>



<p>The opening of these universities does raise a dire concern among many experts and scholars that foreign universities will focus more on profit-making rather than improving the quality of education in the country. The fact that the UGC has allowed the universities to repatriate funds to their parent university makes the concern even more relevant. Doesn’t it look like a money-making scheme in the name of foreign investment?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The draft has introduced the concept of “Education Abroad in India”. According to the UGC regulations, the qualifications of the faculty will be at par with that of the faculty at the parent university. The foreign faculty will only be willing to move to India if they have the guarantee of a better lifestyle (particularly the reason why Indian students move abroad) or if they are offered a decent salary hike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UGC has given autonomy to Partner Foreign Universities. On the contrary, the UGC wants to set a definite admission process and is taking a keen interest in all matters when it comes to domestic universities. This is what Pratap Bhanu Mehta, a columnist with The India Express has called “<a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ugc-guidelines-foreign-universities-in-india-pratap-bhanu-mehta-opinion-8367022/">reverse discrimination against Indian”</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>No doubt, it is a progressive move but at the same time, it also has many loopholes. The reform does intend to introduce equality. Clauses allowing foreign universities not having to follow the reservation system and giving autonomy in the hiring process are pragmatic in&nbsp; nature. Although, the autonomy status does question the genuinity of the reform but it also comes with certain perks.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Can This Reform Fall Apart?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>These are many hypothesis for this, here are three of them:&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Cost of Study</strong></h4>



<p>The set of foreign universities seems a mere theory and the practical aspect seems blurry. Indian students must pay approximately Rs 70 lakh per annum to study at Harvard, Yale or Stanford and over Rs 55 lakh per annum to study at Oxford or Cambridge. Thus, the tuition fees alone would be about 15 times more expensive than Indian private universities and over a hundred times more costly than most Indian public universities. Therefore, it seems that foreign university campuses will only be for the rich.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2.<strong>Cost of Setting and Quality of Education</strong></h4>



<p>India is proud to have many multi-millionaires in the country. But, do they want to invest in the country’s higher education? No! Why? And if they don’t want to invest, why would foreign universities want to do that?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with that, here are some of the problems that may arise while setting up campuses in India:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>The cost of setting up a campus is a herculean task because land and capital is not cheap</li><li>The quality of education and research in an overseas campus can not be at par with the primary campus</li><li>Why would people in foreign countries want to shift to India when Indian students visit their country for a better lifestyle</li></ol>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Physical Set-Up is Not Necessary&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>The rise of online and distance education has transformed the way universities perceive education. Many foreign universities have collaborated with various online learning platforms such as Coursera, Udemy and others to impart education. Hence, it suggests that a physical set-up of campus is not necessary to gain an excellent education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over a period of time, the universities are open to collaboration with other institutions nationally and internally. Through these collaborations, the universities offer faculty exchange programmes, semester abroad programmes, research facilities, and much more. This has increased the mobility of faculty, services, and students which requires less face-to-face interaction.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion:&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>It is a bold move that can surely help improve the quality of higher education in India. But in order to achieve the goal of becoming a global leader in this domain, we must focus on improving the quality of education in national universities. Only then the goal of becoming students’ favourite education destination can be achieved. Therefore, rather than rolling out the red carpet for foreign universities, the government should focus on the infrastructural development of domestic institutions. The National Education Policy 2020 has laid out the roadmap for realising this vision. Now, the need is to walk along the principles set by it.</p>

<p>On January 5, 2023, the University Grants Commission (UGC) released a draft stating that India is officially open to welcoming foreign universities in the country. This will transform India’s approach to higher education and benefit the students incredibly. But it also raises many questions. How will the government safeguard the interest of our country? Why did this draft not get approval in the previous years? Will foreign universities be given complete autonomy? Are these universities willing to hire Indian professors &amp; teachers? And what does the future of India&#8217;s higher education look like?&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s This Noise About Foreign Universities Entering the Indian Market?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>According to the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/foreign-universities-india-campus-8366318/">UGC report</a>, many <strong>“European Countries”</strong> are interested in expanding their roots in India. The <strong>University of Birmingham</strong> released an official response which said, <em>“We are always open to opportunities for partnership working. We would also point Indian students toward the excellent study opportunities available at the University of Birmingham in both UK and Dubai.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Another college that is<strong> King’s College, London has signed MoU with the government of Telangana</strong> for collaborative research, staff &amp; student exchange, curriculum development, and upskilling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These collaborations and the keen interest of foreign universities in Indian institutions is a testimony to the fact that India is an excellent economy to invest in.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Attracts Foreign Investment in India?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Studies have shown that after the United States, India currently has the second-largest higher education system. Thus, the education sector in our nation has a very high potential for growth. The market for distance education was valued at 39 billion in 2018, and by 2024, it is expected to rise to 360 billion. By the end of 2020, there were more than 988 universities and about 40,000 colleges already established in India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the AISHE stats, the gross enrollment ratio has grown by 0.8%, with a constant increase of 18.2% in female enrollments. This level of growth necessitates significant financial commitment which is not feasible simply through the government. As a result, it encourages and supports investments from the private sector. Furthermore, it promotes foreign direct investment in the sector.</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The NEP 2020 Vision</strong></h3>



<p>The latest UGC draft is in line with National Education Policy 2020 (NEP). NEP envisioned the internationalisation of higher education and stated its vision that “top universities in the world will be facilitated to operate in India.” It reflects that the government has thoughtfully taken this action to attract foreign investment in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The UGC Draft</strong></h3>



<p>The draft was announced by the UGC Chairman, Dr. M Jagadesh Kumar which laid down the following key points:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>The universities that are among the top 500 in QS Ranking in the overall category or subject-wise category are eligible to apply in India&nbsp;</li><li>If the universities do not participate in such rankings then they must be reputable in their country</li><li>The foreign university can decide its fee structure, hiring process, admission process, and the Indian government will not have any say in such matters</li><li>The foreign universities can repatriate to their parent university</li><li>The courses offered by these universities should not be against the interest of India’s interests and beliefs&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/MBVi5iFH67Jf8Cca-cvAU0_vVFmExVvYT-2gTEaS7VXX2-UrI_dDWWVyvYT8igVH82QKH0x_8oydlUXJZdwjYNahMV-OiS7n277XKRb7fJTI9HiYE8jOg4jsXs4jUMS5_zs4AOSZrDcX3Vm2RGP20HkLjTjqIMd25Esy59svpFoVfOpeQ_QqbO43Z9IUXQ" alt="" width="737" height="366"/></figure></div>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Have Foreign Universities Received Complete Autonomy?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>According to the official draft, the Indian government will not interfere in matters of foreign universities. They have been given the freedom to set their fee structure for both Indian and international students.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They are also not obligated to follow the reservation system that is popular in India otherwise. Additionally, they can also follow their own process for hiring.</p>



<p>Although the draft did mention that they are advised to include scholarships by Foreign Higher Educational Institution (FHEI). Furthermore, the government has said that the fee structure should be “transparent and reasonable.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ceqTzQgRDlFO6mZvTJwPEKEErLV6Xp7fUCLs9JIDlRerhsFmkPpZri0-DH4lJE8MvBvAYDbykidWTSXb2EvyINaEcP_BpIlGppZdViEecqn6tdAXCPBn6-4_iENeY_jmAgJjiMdVMvCgp9s1bhIVX8Gym4TJm1qVFHWJfVvIgEiG-MMNhzvtRjKQ_QpgJQ" alt="" width="400" height="319"/></figure></div>



<div style="height:3px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How does the Government Safeguard Indian Interests?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The UGC has set the following parameters to safeguard the Indian national interests:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>The UGC can examine the university campuses at any time&nbsp;</li><li>The universities have to abide by India’s anti-ragging and other criminal law policies</li><li>The UGC can suspend or withdraw the university’s approval if its actions are against the policies of India</li><li>The foreign universities have to submit an audit and annual report stating that their working is in line with Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999</li></ol>



<div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How is It Beneficial?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“Presence of Foreign Higher Education Institutions here will enable Indian students obtain foreign qualifications at affordable cost, and make India an attractive study destination.”</em></p><cite>M Jagadesh Kumar, UGC Chairperson&nbsp;</cite></blockquote>



<p></p>



<p>Although it is too early to say anything but majorly the benefits that can be seen of foreign university entering higher education sector in India are:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Foreign students will invest in the courses. Thus, it will directly contribute the country’s GDP</li><li>In order to compete with these universities, IITs, IIMs, private universities will also make necessary changes in their curriculum, opportunities and other procedures</li><li>It is easier for Indian students to study in their dream universities yet stay in the country</li><li>It will also reduce visa and other immigration issues&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>This is broadly what the new UGC policy looks like and in the coming future we will unfold more information. Till then visit our page for more updates.</p>
