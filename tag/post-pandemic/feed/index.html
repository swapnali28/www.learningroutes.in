<p>For those who aspire to control the world, education is the hand that rocks the cradle.</p>



<p>Prior to the epidemic, brick-and-mortar learning institutions were preferred over online degrees. However, the outbreak of the epidemic has confined everyone to their homes, increasing the appeal of online learning.</p>



<p>‘Is the degree valid?&#8217;, ‘Will I get a job if I have an online degree?&#8217;, ‘Will I be able to work abroad?&#8217;, and ‘Is the degree acknowledged internationally?&#8217;&nbsp; are just a few of the key questions that these online degrees raise.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at these issues to clear things out once and for all.</p>



<p><strong><em>Is it possible to earn a degree online? – Yes, it is correct. Yes, it is.</em></strong></p>



<p>It&#8217;s understandable that such a worry arises because the tangible part of online degrees is limited, increasing the possibility of manipulation. However, there are accreditation bodies that issue a certificate stating that the degree is genuine and that the company/institution has completed all of the requirements and meets all of the characteristics.</p>



<p>NGASCE NMIMS is one such university, approved &amp; recognised by University Grants Commission (UGC) &amp; the Distance Education Bureau (UGC-DEB) of India. In 2018, we were granted Autonomy Category I by UGC&nbsp; (University Grants Commission), thereby giving us a blanket approval to offer programs through open &amp; distance learning modes. The National Assessment and Accreditation Council have accredited us with Grade A+ in its 3rd cycle of assessment in 2018, which signifies the highest standards of academic leadership.</p>



<p>Other than <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/nmims-ngasce/">NGASCE NMIMS</a>, there are certain MBA colleges and programs&nbsp; that we have selected as the best Distance MBA University and Colleges in India<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Distance MBA University/College</strong></td><td><strong>Key Strength</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Symbiosis Centre for Distance Learning (SCDL)</td><td>• Symbiosis University Brand<br>• Large number of programs for every need<br>• High acceptance in the industry</td></tr><tr><td>IMT-Centre for Distance Learning (IMT-CDL) Ghaziabad</td><td>• Sister institute of IMT Ghaziabad, a Top 20 B-school<br>• Good acceptance in the industry</td></tr><tr><td>Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU)</td><td>• Huge network of 378 IGNOU study/counseling centers<br>• Affordable fee</td></tr><tr><td>Sikkim Manipal University- Distance Education, Sikkim</td><td>• Affiliated to Manu University, a well known Brand<br>• 5 Lakh Alumni network</td></tr><tr><td>Welingkar Institute of Management (WeSchool)</td><td>• Part of WE School, one of the leading B-schools in Mumbai/Western India<br>• Industry relevance curriculum with workshops, Industry visits, simulation games etc</td></tr><tr><td>Amity University</td><td>• 11 areas of specialization to choose from.<br>• Dynamic&nbsp;course material shared electronically&nbsp;with 24X7 online learning facilities</td></tr><tr><td>Annamalai University, Tamilnadu</td><td>• Well known Public University<br>• Low Fee</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>A degree from a reputable institution with all necessary accreditations will be recognised as authentic proof of course completion and possession of the needed competencies, and will thus be accepted worldwide.</p>



<p><strong>Employer expectations for online degrees are as follows:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Because many businesses are concerned about degree level, a postgraduate degree will have a greater impact than a bachelor&#8217;s degree.</li><li>Authentic certificate from a well-known institution</li><li>A relevant degree that meets the job&#8217;s requirements.</li><li>An online degree demonstrates the candidate&#8217;s commitment and willingness to learn new skills.</li><li>Experience and abilities that are relevant.</li></ul>



<p>Now for those who are interested in distance learning programs can go for some of the trending subjects such as&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/certification-program-in-project-management/">Certificate Program In Project Management</a></li><li><a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/professional-diploma-in-digital-marketing-in-partnership-with-stukent/">Professional Diploma In Digital Marketing</a></li><li><a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/m-sc-in-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/">Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine Learning Ops</a></li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Finally, employers perceive online learning and online degrees to be valid, authentic,&nbsp;and relevant</em></strong></p>
