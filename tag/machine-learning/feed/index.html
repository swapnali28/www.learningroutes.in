<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are two buzzwords these days. People frequently use the terms interchangeably when referring to intelligent software or systems.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that they are both based on statistics and mathematics, AI and machine learning are not the same.</p>



<p>In this post, you&#8217;ll learn the differences between AI and machine learning, as well as some practical examples to help you understand them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is AI, or Artificial Intelligence?</strong></h2>



<p>The ability of a computer or machine to copy or reproduce human intelligent behavior and accomplish human-like activities is known as artificial intelligence or AI.</p>



<p>Artificial intelligence can think, reason, learn from experience, and, most crucially, make its own judgments, all of which require human intelligence.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>&#8220;Artificial intelligence (AI) is the science and engineering of creating intelligent machines.&#8221; — McCarthy, John</strong></p></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Picture-1-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8983"/></figure>



<p>Artificial intelligence can do a lot of things, but it hasn&#8217;t yet mastered the capacity to communicate with people on an emotional level.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s look at some examples of artificial intelligence in action to learn more about it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Personal Assistants</strong></h3>



<p>Personal assistant tools, which are Human-AI interaction gadgets, are another kind of AI. Google Home, Apple&#8217;s Siri, Amazon&#8217;s Alexa, and Microsoft&#8217;s Cortana are the most popular personal assistants.</p>



<p>Users can use these personal assistants to look up information, book hotels, add events to calendars, answer queries, plan meetings, and send messages or emails, among other things.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Robotics</strong></h3>



<p>A good example of AI is an industrial robot. To avoid costly downtime, industrial robots can check their own accuracy and performance and sense or detect when the repair is required. It can also act in a new or unfamiliar setting.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is ML, or Machine Learning?</strong></h2>



<p>Machine learning, or ML, is a subset of artificial intelligence that can learn from data without being explicitly programmed or aided by domain knowledge.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In machine learning, learning refers to a machine&#8217;s ability to learn from data, as well as an ML algorithm&#8217;s ability to train a model, assess its performance or accuracy, and then generate predictions.</p></blockquote>



<p>For example, supervised machine learning techniques like Random Forest and Decision Trees can be used to train a system.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8982"/></figure>



<p>The goal of machine learning is to allow machines to learn from their own data and make accurate predictions.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s look at some Machine Learning examples to learn more.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Email Spam and Malware Filtering</strong></h3>



<p>Spam (unwanted commercial bulk email) has become a major issue for internet users. Machine learning algorithms are being used by the majority of email service providers to automatically learn and identify spam emails and phishing messages.</p>



<p>Gmail and Yahoo mail spam filters, for example, do more than just looking for spam emails based on pre-defined algorithms. As they continue their spam filtering activities, they build new rules based on what they&#8217;ve learned.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Product Recommendations</strong></h3>



<p>Machine learning tools are available on most e-commerce platforms, and they provide product recommendations based on previous data.</p>



<p>For example, if you search for machine learning books on Amazon and then purchase one when you return after a set length of time, Amazon&#8217;s home page will display a list of machine learning books.</p>



<p>It also provides suggestions based on what you&#8217;ve liked, what you&#8217;ve placed to your cart and other similar actions.</p>



<p><strong>Related Topic:</strong> <a href="https://www.learningroutes.in/scope-of-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-in-india/">Scope Of Artificial Intelligence And Machine Learning In India</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The major difference between AI and ML are:</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</strong></td><td><strong>MACHINE LEARNING</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Artificial intelligence (AI) is described as the ability to learn and apply knowledge, while intelligence is defined as the acquisition of knowledge.</td><td>Machine Learning (ML) is described as the acquisition of knowledge or expertise by a computer.</td></tr><tr><td>The goal is to enhance the likelihood of success rather than accuracy.</td><td>Its goal is to improve accuracy, but it is unconcerned about success.</td></tr><tr><td>It functions like a computer program that performs intelligent tasks.</td><td>It&#8217;s a simple concept: a machine gathers information and learns from it.</td></tr><tr><td>The idea is to create a computer model of natural intelligence that can solve complex problems.</td><td>The idea is to learn from data on a specific task in order to maximize the machine&#8217;s performance on that task.</td></tr><tr><td>AI is decision-making.</td><td>Machine learning (ML) is a technique that allows a computer system to learn new things from data.</td></tr><tr><td>It leads to the creation of a system that can imitate human behavior in a certain context.</td><td>It entails the development of self-learning algorithms.</td></tr><tr><td>AI will go for finding the optimal solution.</td><td>ML will choose the best answer regardless of whether it is optimal.</td></tr><tr><td>AI leads to intelligence or wisdom.</td><td>ML leads to knowledge.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h2>



<p>To summarise, AI is a subset of artificial intelligence that solves specific tasks by learning from data and generating predictions, whereas ML is a subset of artificial intelligence that solves problems that require human intellect.</p>



<p>This indicates that every AI is machine learning, but not all machine learning is AI.</p>

<p>We are a privileged generation to live in this era full of technological advancements. Gone are the days when almost everything was done manually, and now we live in the time where a lot of work is taken over by machines, software, and various automatic processes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before having an insight into what are the benefits of pursuing an <strong><em>M.Sc. in AI and ML from NMIMS</em></strong>, it is very important for you to have an understanding of what exactly AI and ML is and why you should go for it, or what are the future benefits of AI and ML which can help you foster your career growth. So let&#8217;s start with getting a very basic understanding of what AI and ML is.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</strong></h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><em>Intelligence: “Ability to learn, understand and think”</em></strong></p></blockquote>



<p>Artificial intelligence or AI is nothing but the science of computers and machines developing intelligence like humans. In this technology, the machines are able to do some of the simple to complex stuff that humans need to do on a regular basis. John McCarthy coined the term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ in the 1950s. He said, ‘Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions, and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.’</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Machine Learning (ML)?</strong></h2>



<p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). Machine learning algorithms allow AI to not only process that data, but to use it to learn and get smarter, without needing any additional programming.&nbsp;With increased data and experience, the results of machine learning are more accurate—much like how humans improve with more practice.</p>



<p>The adaptability of machine learning makes it a great choice in scenarios where the data is always changing, the nature of the request or task is always shifting, or coding a solution would be effectively impossible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Growing demand of AI and ML</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="678" height="484" src="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7846" srcset="https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image.png 678w, https://www.learningroutes.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></figure>



<p>There is no denying the fact that Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are influencing every part of the tech industry. AI and ML are everywhere, from the corporate world to gaming stations, and perhaps, more than our regular lives, AI is impacting the business world more.</p>



<p>Tech giants like Facebook and Google have placed huge bets on machine learning, and they are already using this technology in their products.</p>



<p>But this is only the beginning. Businesses have seen a massive unraveling of the AI and ML phenomena as they find the possibilities of their application in various fields. For example, researchers started using Machine Learning to gain insights into the recent global pandemic that brought the world to a standstill. Businesses are already on the patch to create more robust virtual work environments leading to heightened demand for AI and ML professionals.</p>
